20439,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 32 GB, Marine Blue - with Special Offers","I have an older Fire HD 7 and had started reading a lot more periodicals on it (okay, I admit it, comic books). So when the news about the Fire HD 8 7th generation went out, I put in a pre-order and eagerly anticipated its arrival so I could have just a slightly larger screen and better performance.The Fire HD 8 delivered on those two fronts. It's noticeably snappier than my HD 7, and the screen is larger. No arguing those points.My Fire HD 8 arrived charged to 73%, so I hooked it up to the included charger and set it to download some of the aforementioned periodicals. I checked on it two hours later and noticed that it had managed a measly 4% increase in battery charge in that time. Starting at 73%, I would have expected it to at least be in the mid to high 80s after two hours.After experimenting a bit, I found that the only way I could get a sort of decent charging speed was to turn the Fire HD off altogether and let it charge with absolutely nothing else running. I am now able to charge at a rate of about 1% every 10 to 15 minutes, an improvement over 1% per half hour, but it means having to fully turn off the Fire HD before I plug it in and then restart it when I want to use it again. The Fire HD 8 will maintain an even charge level while it is plugged in and in use, but don't expect it to replenish the battery in that state.Aside from that, the Fire HD 8 seems a decent tablet for a $100 price point. Just don't expect it to fully charge overnight if you deplete it the day before.",3.0

20760,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 32 GB, Marine Blue - with Special Offers","I grabbed this when it was on sale for Black Friday because it was such a good price. I had a regular Kindle before & traded it in to Amazon with the intention of getting another regular Kindle but I never did. In the meantime I did get an iPad Pro & I thought that would function as my Kindle/e-reader. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my iPad. But the iPad Pro is just way too big to comfortably read in bed (12.9‚Äù) or carry around in my bag to have with me when I expect to be in a waiting room somewhere & might want a book or magazine. It‚Äôs also too big (and too expensive) to bring to the gym to set on the treadmill to watch a TV show while I workout. So I grabbed this Kindle hoping it would be everything my iPad is not. So far it does everything I need it to do. It was easy to set up right out of the box. I easily synced it with my Amazon account so I could pull my books, music, movies, & TV shows right from my Amazon account right away. I did add the Netflix and Hulu apps so I could watch some shows while I worked out. The screen is great. The picture is crisp and clear & way better than I expected. The sound is fantastic. It is easy to read on (which should be no surprise since that it was Kindles are made to do). I like that it integrates so easily with my Goodreads account. I haven‚Äôt spent much time browsing the web on it since that‚Äôs not what I bought it for. So I can‚Äôt speak to how it functions as a traditional tablet. But as an e-reader and media player, it is fantastic. I have had some issues with the SD card alerting me that it has been removed when it wasn‚Äôt, but some research showed me that it is not an uncommon issue with these Kindles & I‚Äôm hopeful that it will be resolved soon. Overall this is a great little tablet. It‚Äôs small & lightweight enough to just throw in my bag & have with me wherever I go. The size is perfect to read a book, but also a great size to watch a movie on when you‚Äôre on the go. It also feels pretty sturdy. I did buy a case for it, but I feel like it‚Äôs pretty solid on its own.",4.0

After BB Reward Zone $ I got it for about $100ish with 32gb of memory.To be clear, this is not on the same level as the iPad mini but it was not designed to. Technical specs not quite as good but for $100ish dollars from a reputable company it is not bad at all. The first thing to note is that it does not come with the ability to download from the Google Play Store. You can can get around this by side loading Google and there are plenty of websites to tell you how to this very easily.My wife has been burning it up with this tablet and she really likes it.
