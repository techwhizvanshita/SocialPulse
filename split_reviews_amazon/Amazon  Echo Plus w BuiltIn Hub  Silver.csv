1433,Amazon - Echo Plus w/ Built-In Hub - Silver,I bought the echo plus that is supposed to come with a Phillips Hue light bulb. I got the echo plus but no light bulb. I contacted Elite Plus and after a very long go around was told I would get a $20 credit on the best buy gift card that I used as part of the payment. I was told it would take up to 15 days to get the credit (why so long). I was also told I would get an email stating info about the credit. I still have not gotten the email. I have my doubts if I will ever see the $20 put back on my gift card. This is the second time I have ordered a bundle from Best Buy online and have received the main item but not the bundled items. Last year I bought a friend a PS4 bundle for XMas. They got the PS4 but none of the included games. I had to call and get the games sent out separately. I don't know what is the problem is with their online ordering when bundled items are included. I am getting very wary of ordering anything online with Best Buy that I will get what I ordered on time. BTW... I really like the Echo Plus.

The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs.",5.0
