3341,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go, but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day.",5.0

3343,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","Excellent Ereader if that is all you are looking for. Probably a bit over priced for the casual reader, the Voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality.",4.0
3344,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","I have an old Kindle Touch, the last one that still had text-to-voice, which no longer works. I decided to upgrade, started reading the reviews, was enticed by the The Kindle Voyage and took the plunge. The Voyage is pretty and sleek, with neat features, and I enjoyed using it for a few days, but my frugal self just couldn't justify the price difference between it and the PaperWhite. While the ambient light sensor was nice, I often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room. I made more errors of turning a page than I meant to with the ""page turn"" because of where the page turn spots are located, plus, I'm in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet, so I kept swiping despite the availability of page turn. However, the clarity of the screen, the quality of the light, the form factor, the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice. Nonetheless, the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the Paperwhite. The thing I miss most about the Voyage is the quality of the light, and how even the lighting is on it. The unit I had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page, or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the Voyage. I purchased the newest model of the Paperwhite and I like it, but the lighting appears pretty dingy. However, it's only when they're compared side-to-side that I wished I wasn't so cost conscious. If money is not an object, I'd say get the Kindle Voyage, if it is, the Paperwhite is a fine little reader, and overall I'm happy I have it.",4.0
3345,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle...,5.0
3346,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","I or a family member have owned every version of the Kindle since it came out. This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit. It is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I'm a fan of the buttons), and an excellent back-light. Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time. The only downside is that I'm not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight. By far the best e-reader out there, and a worthy upgrade from a previous version",5.0
3347,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets. The only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our WiFi network and then won't connect to the Kindle store. I don't think it's an issue with my network since all our other devices don't have the connectivity issues we had with this.",4.0
3348,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Have had it for a while noe. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.,3.0
3349,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","I am extremely happy with my new Kindle Voyage. The text is so sharp and crisp, the images look much better than on the Kindle Paperwhite. The device is extremely light and comfortable to hold, The adaptive front light works great. I have an iPad with the Kindle app, but the reading experience is so much better on my Kindle Voyage that don't regret the purchase one bit.",5.0
3350,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental browser is not very user friendly.",3.0
3351,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","Even though it is a little pricy, I like my new Kindle Voyage. It looks smaller, but it is because it's only the screen - no buttons. It is lightweight. You can scroll and turn pages with touch screen press or with physical small buttons on the side. It is automatically adjusts to different light conditions.",5.0

3355,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","Great looking display. Text is sharp and easy to read. The lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments. This is a little more compact than the paper white model. I really love the page press button areas. Makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand (as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area). Sounds like a minor thing, but to me it's a big convenience!",5.0
3356,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Do most of my reading on one of my Kindles. Reading in sun light to no light is great. Easier to take anywhere size wise compared to a paperback.

3363,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",I have been using the paperwhite for about 2 years now and this unit definitely beats it. The adaptive lighting is amazing and page turn buttons are quite useful. If you are looking for an E-Reader then this is the one for you.,5.0
3364,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Great alternative to using tablet for reading. Only problem is trying to read a *.pdf file - it only enlarges the page and does not resize the document to easily move forward.,4.0
3365,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","It is a good reading device. When the price drop to 100 dollar, it is a deal. You need to buy one at that level.",5.0
3366,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","I have both the Kindle Voyage and the low end Kindle Fire.While the $50.00 Fire is an amazing deal, for serious readin,g the Kindle Voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution. Now, it lacks many of the features of the less expensive Fire, such as color and online with Wifi; as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure.Truthfully, it isn't a whole lot better than the Paperwhite. It has a feature or two, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra 60 dollars. It is still an excellent device.",5.0

3370,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","So much better than reading on an iPad, completely worth it. I guess my only complaint is the operating system still seems a little weak in terms of responsiveness and fluidity but doesn't really impact regular usage of just page turning, only felt while browsing the library/store etc.",5.0

3375,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Love my Kindle Voyage. The size is much smaller than my older Kindle and the weight is much less. This helps as I take fm Kindle everywhere. Love the touch screen features.,5.0
3376,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","One of the things I love the most about my new Kindle is it's size. It slides so nicely into my compact purse, protective case and all. Another thing I've noticed is the lack of glare that I experienced with my old Kindle. It automatically adjusts to the light and I'm looking forward to being able to read it on the beach without a struggle. I also love the battery life - it goes on forever. The case I bought makes it possible to stand my Kindle up in front of me and read while I'm eating - a must for me - I never eat alone ;)",5.0
3377,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",What a great ereader. Amazon continues its dominance in the ereader field with this entry. Light and comfortable to hold. Perfect combination of hepatic feedback buttons and adaptive back-lighting. Seems to stay charged forever even with regular use. I would definitely recommend this and would buy again.,5.0

3380,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","This is my first kindle but I'm loving it. I picked it up a few days after it was released. One of the things I love the most is I'm a reader but I am not a car owner so I get almost everywhere by bike. I got tired of lugging around heavy hardcover books from the library; now my Voyage weighs less than most paperback books. An extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket I wasn't using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes. I also love that I charged it when I got 4 days ago and it is still more than have battery power.",5.0

3384,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","This is by far the best reader for all lighting environments. The only drawback I see are the constant ads when you log on to the device, and the library interfaceneeds to be more intuitive. However, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and use of this Voyage. I've already read over six books with it in just 3+ weeks.",4.0
3385,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","I have a previous version of the Kindle, but this one surpasses it in every way, from the resolution to the automatic brightness display. Recommend it highly.",5.0
3386,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",The Kindle voyager is absolutely a best product for reading ebooks. The product is easy to read in all types of light. I also like the ability to get word definitions and the expansion or text ability.,5.0
3387,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","Upgrading from an older Kindle. Wow. Lighter. Crisper text is an understatement. Throw in the lighting and the new interface for page advancement. Pricey but if you want the best, you won't be disappointed.",5.0
3388,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","It's a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though.",4.0
3389,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",I've always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now I've resisted moving to electronic media when reading for pleasure.

3390,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",We upgraded from an older paper white and couldn't be happier.,5.0
3391,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",I have had several variations of the Kindle in the past. My most recent being a paperwhite. I have to say this is the best. The size and balance are better. The adaptable light feature and brightness is good. Screen quality and construction are both an improvement. The overall reading experience is much improved over the paperwhite.,5.0
3392,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","I really missed my first kindle when my husband gave me a fire 2 years ago. I love to read outside and could not do that with a fire. The voyage is perfect, easy to read anywhere, much longer battery life than a fire. Very happy with it and the buttons are easy to use or you can just tap the screen to turn the page.",5.0

3395,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","I had to ask for help because they don't keep this model on display, it's ""behind the counter"". But other than that, in-store was a breeze. And the product exceeds my expectations. Although, it would be even better if it was waterproof--- but it does perfectly fit into a medium baggie.",5.0

3400,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",I never owned a Kindle before. This was easy to setup and get going.It also looks really good. The text is super easy to read even at smaller fonts. I also really like the buttons on the side that turn the pages because it is a lot easier to flip pages compared to tapping the screen.,5.0
3401,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader.",4.0

3407,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","This eReader is great, I have started reading more now that I have this kindle than when I read paperbacks. If you are torn on buying this for yourself or someone else I can almost guarantee anyone would love this. With enabled dictionaries and X-ray I'm finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like Game of Thrones. I'm serious, this is so convienent and user friendly. The only negative about this device is the amount of money you will spend on new books in excitement when you first connect to Amazon with it.",5.0

3409,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value.

3410,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","My first ebook reader. Read some reviews, decided to go with this because of the backlight and adaptive light. Sometimes I have to adjust the light manually but no biggie, quick and easy on the eyes.",5.0
3411,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","We bought this reader to replace a Fire HDX that had seemed to go wonky.

3414,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand.",4.0

3419,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working.",1.0
3420,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",I had been reading books on my iPad for years and finally broke down to get a kindle. It's exactly what I hoped. The screen is easy to read in any light. It's a light weight and size and easy to stow away in a small bag.,5.0
3421,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",This is my first e reader. I did ttry my friends papperwhite but voyage is the best of the e reader world. The screen is awesome. I read a lot at night before I sleep and I use to read in my mobile which after sometime feels like my eyes are burning. But with voyage I can read as much time I want. No strain no burning sensation in my eyes. Compared to the papperwhite the screen looks better. Feels like I am actually reading a paper book.,5.0
3422,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black","I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it.",5.0
