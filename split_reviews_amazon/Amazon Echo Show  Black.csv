8349,Amazon Echo Show - Black,Pros: I love the Alexa series so when this one went on sale I had to get it with a camera. Now I can watch my security cameras from my couch or even drop in and see whats going on in other places. The audio is nice and loud and the picture is clear Cons: I wish I could stop the screen from turning off I keep thinking its unplugged but its saving power I guess,5.0
