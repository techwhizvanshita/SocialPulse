Amazon Fire Tv,,,","This is my 2nd Echo, and I also have two of the smaller Dots. Amazon has now enabled multi-room music playing, with all your speakers that you've designated perfectly synced with each other. It also serves as a good quality Bluetooth speaker so you can use it with any other app on your device for sound. I also use it to control my connected lights and can even operate my entertainment system through a logitech hub. And, the voice assistant Alexa is just getting smarter and smarter with every passing month. Get it on sale when it's under 100 dollars and it makes one of the most useful electronics purchases you could make!",5.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",Alexis had to learn news skills before it was useful. Getting better,4.0
25366,"Amazon Fire Tv,,,
Amazon Fire Tv,,,","I thought this would have a better sound than the Google Home Assistant based on price ($50 more when not on sale) and description of speaker. Ran the two side by side and I thought the Google Home had a better sound. Neither one is a main speaker in my room but sometimes it is easier to just ask them to play a station on Pandora or Radio than going to the main sound system. As for what Alexa can and can't do...that is tough to say since we don't have any smart devices in the house at that moment. It works well for quick weather, news and traffic reports but not so good for a free-form question. Google was more intuitive and better at understanding the question. With Alexa, if you have not downloaded the ""skill"" then there is a chance that she won't understand. Still, she is very good at keeping track of shopping lists and at some point I will add smart lights, thermostats, garage door opener, etc. to the house so hopefully the convenience will make things better.",4.0
25367,"Amazon Fire Tv,,,
Amazon Fire Tv,,,",I use the Echo every day! From getting weather to daily news to listening to SiriusXM I can say the device is very simple to use.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","I love my Alexa! I renamed her Computer because of Star Trek. We have so much fun listening to music, playing games and telling her to clean the house with our Neato botvac or turn on the sprinklers with our Rachio irrigation controller. As we learn more cool things this personal assistant can do the happier I am we purchased one. We like it so much we purchased another for our bedroom and a Dot for our daughters room. They work together as an intercom system too so no more yelling for one another or texting, admit it, you do it too, we can now just drop in and talk to one another. I am planning to continue purchasing items that Alexa can control and look forward to the advancement in personal assistant technology. So many things she can do already!!! I highly recommend getting 1 or 2 or 3!!!",5.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",We have one at home to we thought it would be fun to have at the office to place music. However you can only stream 1 Alexa per music account which is annoying.

25436,"Amazon Fire Tv,,,
Amazon Fire Tv,,,","She's tall and smart! She's sensible. Soft spoken but firm. She can answer (most) questions without a hesitation! She's all fact! She hears well. She has a good ""lung"" when we want her to sing loud! She can tell jokes -- not ""ha ha, too funny"", but good enough! Amazon Prime/music plays a big part of her -- another word she'd mostly be muted if we don't play music from Alexa (she sings for the dog too when we leave home). Like it that can ask her to play songs of the year, i.e. 1969 vs. by category or musicians. Glad brought her home! Fun with her around! She was on a one-day sale at BBY when I paid for her, so it's all good! I don't believe in paying full price, even for something as smart as Alexa!",5.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","My review is not a review of the device as much as my opinion on which product to choose when trying to decide between this and Google home.Google home is the closest competition in this landscape and its still lacking in comparison to Alexa.All of the interesting features of Google home are non existent or slowly being released. Using these features as a selling point is disingenuous.More than that Google home constantly has trouble detecting my voice and doing any of the assistant commands. In the same environment the echo dot with budget hardware had better success rate. When it did detect it the time to action was x2 as long as Google home is much more ""chatty"".",5.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","The vacation house we rented for a week this summer had an Echo Dot. We didn't know what it was until it started talking to us as we must have activated it somehow. After our shock, we found that it played music, told jokes, and was in general, fun to use. So, we we arrived home, we began exploring what the Echo could do. Wow. It is amazing. We have been Amazon Prime members for many years and this is a logical extension of the Amazon ecosystem. I think most folks who use Prime will be pleasantly surprised by what it can do. However, not everyone likes it. My son-in-law says its creepy to have something listening to you in your home. So, most folks will have to get over that. For the price, it's well worth it to explore the future of technology!",4.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","Just say Alexa and what you want her to do and she does it. Yes sometimes if there is some noise or if you don't speak clearly she might get it wrong but most of the time she gets it right. My only flaw with Alexa is the music, which isn't a problem with the product it's self but when it comes to playing music other than Pandora- you do have to subscribe to unlimited music which is reasonably priced and is worth it but do wish it came with it. Other than that I love asking Alexa to play a certain song and she plays it. She is amazing I would recommend it to anyone. Also look into her cool features their so helpful, definitely her to do list and grocery list.",5.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","My primary reason for purchasing this was to control my new smart home devices. In particular, our Phillips Hue lights. Works great for off/on and dimming at a percentage but can't get the colors and scenes to work. Has to be SO exact with the naming of the lights and wording when you speak to Alexa. Also, making lists is JUST a shopping list. It would be great if I could add to an Amazon wish list instead! Seems like a natural!? Great for checking weather, sports and such. Playing music is hit or miss with my Prime account... to REALLy get everything, you apparently have to have the monthly fee enabled ""unlimited"" feature. Example: I can listen to the Police or Foo Fighters, but no Led Zeppelin - really??? Then it just tries to ""sell you"" the upgrade when you ask it to play something it can't. That's pretty annoying. Looking forward to Apple's version of this. More expensive and still many months away, but since I have an Apple Music account and it will play MY playlists! The Alex Echo was a great price though and a good starting home hub speaker.",4.0

Set up was a breeze with no problems connecting to my home network. At present I am using my Alexia for my morning news briefs while having breakfast. Listening to Bloomberg, CNN, Fox, and Reuters news briefs you pretty much get an insight of whats happening in the world. If you wake her up by saying Alexia, good morning she will give you some interesting information concerning the day. I also use her for reviewing by daily schedule and local weather before heading out. No longer do I have to search in my iPad. Listing to music is a pleasure since the sound is very acceptable and I can change the volume or skip song without even moving. She response to my voice from across the room. The timer function is a help when cooking, and setting a alarm by voice is a great convenience, eliminating some use of my phone. It would be nice to have Alexia call your contacts on your phone with IFTTT but that would involve uploading your contact list to Amazon, something that at the moment I would not do.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","I realize that many people will believe that this product is a cynical attempt to pump up Amazon's profits, and I'm sure it contributes, but don't deny yourself the serious fun this device will bring into your home!We originally bought this as a gift for my seeing-impaired mother-in-law in order for her to enjoy trivia, music and audio books with a hands-free interface. We didn't anticipate enjoying it ourselves so much that I'm not sure we're going to be willing to let it go!!!Setup is dead simple if you already have an Amazon Prime account and wireless Internet access. The audio quality and the unit's ability to cut through ambient noise in order to hear you are remarkable. The device is solidly built and has several nice ergonomic touches such as the rotating, color changing ring of lights that let you know you are being heard to the rotating volume ring at the top of the unit.It is amazing what the Echo can do. I'll leave the voyage of discovery up to each of you. Do get used to hearing ""Hmmm, I'm not sure about that"" or ""I'm still learning about...."" but I am certain that the Echo's cloud based ""brain"" will only get better with time.Do yourself a favor and get one of these, the whole family will enjoy it!",5.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","Having realistic expectations is a must with the Echo. I had thought the AI would be much better than it is. Sometimes you need to say something three times for Alexa to find it. For example if you ask her to play a specific song by a specific artist the first two times she will say there is no song by that particular artist but on the third attempt she finds it. This is with voice training complete mind you. I purchased three echos to use as a starter system to play music on each floor of my house. They did not support whole house play at first but due to high demand they now have a group setting so you can play music simultaneously on all your echos. Be warned though if you ask Alexa to play your group (multiple echos) you cannot play all your devises at once using Spotify for example. Verbally asking Alexa to play the entire group only allows play from amazon music. The Alexa app needs some work but is fairly easy to navigate. I feel Im pretty tech savvy so for those who arent just take some time to browse through the app on your phone. You need to enable skills in order to get responses to certain questions which to me is a big draw back. I think most have the intention of buying the Echo, setting it up, and asking it anything and getting a response without all the extra setup. Remembering specific phrases to get an exact response can be a bit of a hassle. I gave it four stars because it works for playing most music through my whole house without breaking the bank. I think there is still a lot of improvements that could be made and it seems Amazons priority isnt necessarily the Echo. From reviews Ive read the request to play music on multiple devices was something people were asking for since the products release. I was able to pick them up when they were in sale but to be honest if I would have paid full price I would have returned all three and saved my money. Wait until they go on sale and then you can justify some of the shortfalls of the product.",4.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion.I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the Helpful button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","I actually started with an Amazon Echo Dot to see how the whole thing worked without having to spend a lot of money. I was amazed at how cool and useful the Alexa system can be. We were using one Echo Dot to make lists, check the weather, set calendar appointments, set alarms, and even play rainstorm soundtracks to help sleep at night. My birthday was just a couple of weeks ago and my wife got me the Echo as the main Alexa hub in our living room. The built-in speakers sound pretty good for what they are. Definitely a huge improvement over the Dot's built-in speaker, but even the Dot has a nice sound for as small as it is. We now have 4 Echo Dots and the Echo to control all sorts of WEMO switches and outlets around the house. We already had a NEST thermostat which integrated nicely and easily. The best thing is that Alexa understands all of our different voices... even our 4 year old. He can now turn his bedroom light on by asking Alexa to do it so he doesn't have to be afraid of the dark! It really is a very cool and convenient system. My wife thought it was silly at first, but she actually loves it. It's great for playing your iHeart Radio and Pandora stations too!",5.0

This little toy wakes me up every morning and together with her little sister help me avoid burning my food, stay up to date with news, play my favorite music, control Hue Lights, remember things, and read. I slowly grew attached to Alexa and now it's a part of my life that I probably cannot live without. The one thing that I don't do with it is shopping (sorry Amazon) and I shop a lot. I find it cumbersome and unintuitive. Perhaps you can use it to reorder things that you are already familiar with. The sound quality is good enough. Every morning Alexa plays some upbeat music to jump start my day. It's not as good as my UE Megaboom; it lacks bass. Granted, not that many people would expect audiophile music quality from Alexa anyways.The problem with Alexa is still its rather disappointing app selection--both quality and quantity. But I guess the few goods one still imo justify a purchase. My advice is to get one and try it out for a couple of weeks. If it grows on you, keep it. If not, say bye. Alexa won't be sad at all.",4.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","Your mileage may vary, but... I picked up both the Google Home and the Amazon Echo because I wanted to see which one was best. Oddly, Amazon Echo pairs better with my work accounts (GSuite/Google Apps for Biz) because Google Home doesn't do that yet. For home automation, Echo can't be beat. For playing podcasts, Echo is on top of it. For answering questions, Google Home allows me to get to my answer a lot faster with better sources. In terms of audio quality, Echo is top dog. Can it hear you from across the room? Yeah, in fact - mine can hear me from outside my office 3 rooms away.Has it changed my routines? Yep. I love the Flash Briefing. The skills, for now, are mostly useless or ""add-ons"" to the Flash Briefing. It can read your audio books and Kindle books (and they do a freebie monthly) - but as I listen at 3x speed to most of my audio books, it's not the most helpful thing ever (because there's no speed control yet).Is it the Computer from the Enterprise? Not yet. It can't perform complex tasks like, ""Alexa, find me a 4 or 5-star Chinese Restaurant nearby and make a reservation"", cannot call out (hey Skype, where are you?), and cannot send text messages or write emails.There's some connecting the dots that will have to happen for this to be life-changing, but for now, it's pretty good.",5.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","I opted for the Echo over the Dot because of the promise of a better sounding speaker, and because I planned to add Dots to my environment later to create a system of assistants. The speaker sound is not great, but it's not the worst I've heard. I've also recently discovered how to alter the bass and treble volume to tailor the sound a bit. The Echo was easy to set up, and is really easy to use. I especially like the ability to create a shopping list (although I wish I could create more than one list without adding apps), and to easily integrate my Google Calendar. I'm currently exploring other features and ""skills"" for the system, some of which are very entertaining and useful. One disappointment is the limitation of the near-field voice recognition range. Alexa may be always listening, but her ears don't seem to be very good. If I'm more than 15-20 feet or one room away (with not walls between us) she usually doesn't pick up my commands.That not withstanding, she recognizes commands very well, and is very pleasant to interact with.Another issue I discovered is that in order for the echo to access your Spotify music service at all, you have to subscribe to the premium version. I can understand that, given the current propensity for most online services to find ways to require you to subscribe to their premium services in order to really enjoy them. However, with Amazon Music you can access the free version and their premium Amazon Prime version.In the area of smart home capability, I purchased a Philips Hue starter kit with a hub and a couple of smart lights, and was able to get them set up in the app very easily. Alexa does a great job of controlling them for us, but I am disappointed that the only place I can find additional bulbs seems to be online where I have to pay for shipping in addition to tax. Apparently the retailers (Best Buy, Walmart, Home Depot, etc.) haven't seen enough of a demand for them to justify restocking them after their initial quantities were exhausted. I'll be adding other devices as time progresses, and expect to be pleased with the results.",4.0

They are both basically the same device but I did not need the extra powerful bluetooth speaker portion of it as I already have a great speaker at home which I hooked up to the dot and it works amazing. If you dont already have a bluetooth speaker, get the Echo, keep it simple, neat and its a great omnidirectional speaker. I am still amazed at how much power these little devices hold. I learn new ways to interact with Alexa every week and it makes my life easier and more entertaining. I highly recommend this in your home if you have kids, my 3 year old daughter now spends time asking Alexa questions when I am not available.",4.0

Then I decided I wanted a nice, compact music player for my office and started to evaluate options. After reviewing and valuing based on my needs, my office, and ease I decided to get another Echo for the office. The Dot was an option, but the sound quality isn't good enough for me while the Echo is (I'm not a huge music aficionado, just like clear music) and it doesn't require me to keep an extra set of speaker or use up computer resources to stream. I got it, hooked it up to the office wi-fi and use it every day. It gives me the weather forecast, traffic status, miscellaneous information, but most of all, streaming music.And when the phone rings I can pause it quickly using the voice control and then resume when I'm done.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","As a Google Home user I was excited to try its direct competitor, Amazon Echo, since a lot of people that I know have an Echo and are enjoying theirs so far. The setup process is very simple and requires you to download Alexa App for your mobile device. The Alexa App definitely needs more improvement as I found myself having to relaunch the app at times to reconnect the Echo to my wireless network. Alexa has bluetooth connectivity which is great for streaming music from my iPhone, something Google Home does not have currently. The mic is very sensitive which I like so I don't have to speak too loudly to wake the Echo up and it picks up voice from the far end of the living room; the Echo is located in the dining room. Sound quality is pretty good and music did not have too much distortion at higher volumes.The Echo's is more on the heavier side which I like cause I feel the build quality is good. The Echo is tall so the tall black cylinder stands out in my dining room table. I like the 360 speaker and mic design. Volume control can be adjusted by twisting the top upper ring which is simple enough. Amazon Echo uses Bing for querying answers to your questions and this is definitely where I think Echo takes a hit. There were quite a few simple questions I asked Echo that Google Home had no problem answering. Google search is the best, bar none.One of the bonuses of Amazon Echo is surely felt if you are a Amazon Prime member. For example, I asked Echo to check my order status for items I ordered on Amazon and it told me I had items out for delivery today. Also you can ask Echo what are today's deals on Amazon and it asks whether you want to buy the item it mentions. There is a lot of potential and more benefits for Amazon Prime customers.Overall I really enjoyed using the Amazon Echo and I am impressed with the design and build quality. Amazon's usage of Bing for searching is definitely lacking compared to Google. This is a solid complimentary assistant for Amazon Prime Members. Bluetooth is a plus for sure.PROS: Solid build and design quality. Good audio quality. Sensitive mic. Perfect for Amazon Prime Subscribers.CONS: Amazon Bing search is not nearly as good as Google. Alexa App needs improvement.",4.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","I've been considering the whole ""smart home"" phenomenon for a while. Even though I love tech in general, this particular aspect didn't seem to have much appeal for me personally. My impression was that it hadn't quite arrived yet. Then some friends got the Echo along with the Hue lighting system and the Nest thermostat. When I saw how well it all integrated and just how cool it is, I was intrigued. That was enough for me to take the plunge. Now I have all three and I love how they all work together. Alexa is at the heart of it with many handy features. She can give me weather, traffic and news. She can turn on or turn off my lights and adjust the heat. She can set a timer when I'm cooking. She can check my Google calendar to remind me of appointments and birthdays. She can answer many (but certainly not all) of my random trivia questions. Some of her responses are funny and cute Easter eggs. Her built-in shopping and to-do lists are rather basic, so I haven't found much use for them yet. She processes my requests, with only the occasional misunderstanding. Her microphones are sensitive enough to hear me in the living room from the top of the stairs in my townhome (although I did get the optional remote for the bedroom). Only sometimes do I have to repeat myself if I don't speak clearly enough or my phrasing is awkward. Amazingly, she knows to control the correct fixture when, for example, I accidentally say ""table lamp"" instead of ""table light,"" as the bulb is actually labeled in the system. The setup was quick and easy, both for the Echo itself and the integration with the Nest and the Hue bridge. The app is easy to use, with only one minor issue (see below).Her internal speakers aren't spectacular, but they're acceptable for background music while doing chores or puttering around the house. Using the app to establish a connection to the Bluetooth adapter for my old stereo system wasn't particularly intuitive, but following the instructions posted on the Amazon web site got it done. Now I can stream music through the Echo itself or through my stereo for better quality, depending on my mood. You can integrate services like Pandora and Spotify, but I just use Amazon Prime Music, since I already subscribe to it.Naysayers will rightly point out that you can do all of the above things with other simpler devices, and of course, they're right. The Echo is certainly a luxury, a toy even, but it is fun and useful for me. In my experience and for my purposes, it works well with only minor limitations. It met and exceeded my expectations. You have to judge the overall value for yourself, but if you're already considering the Echo and what it can do for you, I strongly recommend it.",5.0

Alexa should be more intuitive than that and should learn and grow as you go along, she does not. You also have to ask things in a way Alexa will understand. For example, you cannot say, ""Alexa, turn out the lights in the kitchen."" That ""does not compute."" But if you say, ""Alexa, shut off the lights."" She will do as you ask.

I use the Echo to control my Philips Hue lights and control all of my home theater devices through my Harmony Hub (and soon, full control over my Dish Hopper through a Dish/Amazon partnership). It's a bit more expensive than I would have liked, and I ended up adding an Echo Dot to the other room, so I didn't have to yell for Alexa to hear me.In hindsight, if you don't need a mediocre bluetooth speaker, get the Echo Dot instead (which you can hook to speakers of your own choice).",4.0

My only regret now is that I didn't buy the echo sooner than I did. I love her, I mean it! Every day I'm integrating the echo into my life and into my home more and more. I even purchased a second one for the bedroom. The one drawback is that I sometimes have to repeat myself a few times before I'm understood. I have found that the more voice training I do, the less frequent I have this problem. And, right out of the box I was surprised at just how accurately Alexa understood and instantly responded with relevant, accurate, and timely information. Yes, I am crazy 'bout Alexa! 8)",5.0

Also have it connected to Fitbit, so if I don't have my phone and the Fitbit is charging, I can just ask how I'm doing. Good weather reports and news briefs, and the best part is you can just say, ""Stop"" when you don't want to hear any more. Convenient saying aloud an item for a grocery or to-do list, then having it on your phone when you get to the store. We've also enjoyed the music (have it connected to speakers in the living room).

The device looks good and the LED light on top that turns on when you speak to it is great. Sound is good for music. However, I did not feel that it was a good assistant. I did not like that you have to download skills to make Alexa have more function. You always had to speak Alexa, and then ask the skill you downloaded. It then gets to a point that you don't even remember what skills you downloaded so you always had to look at your phone or mobile device to see what you had. I exchanged it for the Google Home and it has been a better device. It plays music from Google Music and not only music that you have purchased. It answer a lot of questions and gives you great news briefing instead of downloading the particular skills. It also provides more answers to questions and I was surprise by the detail of the answer at time. I highly recommend to Google Home device.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","Family of 5 and now 6 with Alexa. Seriously she adds another element to our family entertainment and smart home utility. Kids play games with her, like 20 ?s, jeopardy, riddles, jokes, and daily Easter eggs. While the adults like smart concerts, sports highlights, news briefs and all the things your ""Siri"" can do, by more. Like turn on/off your lights, coffee maker, tv, and whatever else you hook your smart outlets to.(sold separately) Now for the ""Alexa bugs."" More often than not, we find ourselves repeating commands. Attempted fix, by using voice training multiple times in areas we are most when aroud Alexa. Saw minor improvement. We also wish the command to increase or lower volume was more efficient. Shouting ""Alexa, volume 5 multiple times after a song you liked was at volume 7 or higher is annoying. We've learned to manually adjust her volume at the base which we can do with our old stereo? I was curious how Alexa would respond to 5 different voice patterns. Surprisingly , once she hears her name and the command prompt, she responds correctly 89% of the time.My wife tells me I'm cheating on ""Siri"" and ""Cortana"" as ""Alexa"" has quickly won my heart and my kids as well. We're glad we went with this, not the dot or google home. If you plan on making voice purchases as commercials advertise, careful- your kids might order 50lbs of cookie dough as Alexa doesn't recognize who's voice is ordering it. Overall, the gimmicks wear off, but we routinely enjoy smart concerts and our smart light system. soon we will be asking these robots to do our dishes, laundry, cook, or whatever else humans don't feel like doing. Hopefully I see this unfold in my lifetime- Brunsch",3.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","The echo has a small problem in that it is a blue tooth receiver only. You can blue tooth your devises to it, tablet , phone ,or other devices. It would be better if you could connect it to a good quality stereo receiver that enable blue tooth. The dot can be connect to blue tooth speakers or blue tooth capable audio receivers. The Dot does have a small speaker in it so if it is not connected you can still use it. The problem with the dot is if you use the included 3.5 mm audio jack it disable the internal speaker. This means you have to have the audio component on to hear the Dot. However the blue tooth connection on the Dot works great. I own a Marantz AV receiver with blue tooth. I tell Alexa to connect and it automatically turns on the receiver, set it to the correct input and is ready to play music or any other audio I want to listen to through the Dot. When I tell Alexa to disconnect it turns of the receiver and switches back to the internal speaker. If you are buying an echo device for a high quality music server using Amazon music then you want an echo Dot.If you want to listen to average sounding speaker that you can place just about any where in your house the Echo is a great product.",4.0

My Wink home automation shortcuts can now be set off by voice command. When I walk in the door with my arms full I simply say ""Alexa, turn on entry lights"". When it is time for the kids to get settled down I say ""Alexa, trigger reading mode"" and all lights are set to the desired levels. Time for bed? ""Alexa, trigger night mode"" and all lights shut off, garage door closes (if left open) and all deadbolts lock on exterior doors. Ask ""Alexa, what's up?"" and she gives current time, temps, forecast and top news. When we sat down with the kids to open Christmas gifts... ""Alexa, play some classic Christmas music"".

I thought this thing was supposed to get smarter as it goes along. We had to sign up for AMAZON Prime and Unlimited Music just to actually listen to decent music. When she does know a command for example like say ""Loop Mode"" when you want her to repeat a song... most of the time she understands that. And then there are a lot of times when she simply beeps out or even says she doesn't understand the question no matter how many times you say it. We use her mostly for a timer, alarm, play music and for 6 questions of Jeopardy a day. Really needs a lot of improvement. Ask her what a dog says.. she says bow wow or woof. *Sigh* If she can only be basic on that answer, there isn't much more she is gonna get right. There are also a lot of pretty useless skills for her available. We got it at a discounted price thankfully and I also got a Dot for in the bedroom at a cheaper price.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","Traded in the Echo for Google Home after trying both. Did the training questions but still found it could only answer 6 of 10 questions. There were many specific apps but trying to remember the cues words is more difficult. Google home answers without cue words the first time and can extend a conversation based on the first question. Can ask for driving times to destinations without an app, same for getting a cocktail recipe. Very dry responses where GH has personality. Try them both before deciding what is best for your needs.",3.0

I know its new technology so I think it definitely worth the money but still can be a better AI in the future. I do wish that Alexa gave you time answer the questions back on certain skills like knock knock jokes, riddles and more...instead she tells you the whole joke without more interaction from the user. I will say i am still pleased from everside but ill be honest i think google home does have some abilities that alexa doesnt but I am still Amazon echo hands down and will be waiting for the next gen Amazon Echo to see where it goes.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","Bestbuy came through before the holiday better than Amazon--item available, arrived within 2 days, competitively priced. Great service there. My problem is with disappointing performance by Echo. Siri wins over Alexa. Issues encountered:1) a skill will be installed, but Alexa will tell me first, I need to install the skill and second, that the skill is already installed. User is stuck in a do-loop with no response.2) access to quick 1-sentence read from Wikipedia is appreciated, but if you ask 'tell me more,' Alexa's voice is so rushed and computerized, some of the information is unintelligible.3) tons of skills, but so many of them are at a micro level and others are 1-time gimmicks. If you are not careful, you then need a skill to help you with all the skills you've installed.4) responses on some of the more interesting skills are just plain wrong. Vocabulary on word master is limited, so you will told your response is not a word that begins with ""X"" and we have had instances where our correct response on Jeopardy is reported as not correct. In one skill about a magic door (?) a clue is described, but when selected, you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again. Frustrating and makes you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly. Children can get frustrated quickly.5) access to music is quirky. Some pieces by classical composers will play only a few minutes of a selection, abruptly stop and begin a new piece. But some singers and ambient pieces will play for hours.Positives: flash briefing, weather, word definitions, Pandora access timer.",1.0

If you ask Alexa a ""google"" type question such as ""What was the score to 'such and such' college basketball game"", most times she cannot answer even if you pose the question a number of ways. Sometimes, you can ask a question differently from the way you would intuitively ask a question and Alexa will answer. This proves frustrating to me.

Alexa voice control is good for playing music, asking about the weather, adding things to a list, setting timers, etc. The only downside is that she is much more limited in her knowledge than Siri is, she can't play from iTunes or apple music, or connect to iPhone notes.

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","Echo is great fun particularly if you have connected devices like Wemo or Lifx bulbs or Next thermostat. At first you think you may not use that much, then you find yourself telling it to turn on the lamp or turn down the thermostat, like when you are cooking and your hands are messy. I have a lot of Wemo switches and Lifx bulbs, and it's fun to group them together and tell Echo to turn on everything and watch it all turn on at once. It's also fun to ask her about actors and actresses on tv while watching, like how old is so and so person. Alexa is not perfect, but she is pretty good at getting things right most times. The bad thing is you'll find yourself wanting to buy more Wemo switches and stuff just to have fun with Echo. Note, Alexa can only control Wemo bulbs by using IFTT, but the switches it has direct integration with. Lifx bulbs have direct integration, but you can't change the colors without IFTT I think, and Nest thermostat has direct integration. Looking to the future for more direct integration of things.",5.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","I went back and forth for quite some time about purchasing the Echo. I watched many YouTube videos and reviews as well as reading a lot about the product itself. I finally caught it on sale and used to gift cards to buy it despite protests from my wife. I have to say Alexa is pretty intuitive and has no issues recognizing my voice. There are times when you have to word a sentence specifically but that is just a minor annoyance. Amazon has done a great job updating the Echo weekly and adding relevant skills such as package tracking and even flight status. I use it mostly for news, weather, shopping lists, reminders, movie times, timers, and occasionally some music. If you have any smart appliances then controlling them with Alexa is really cool. I only have a smart plug right now but it is great to walk in to a dark room and just ask Alexa to turn the light on or when you are about to go to bed and do not want to walk in the dark, just ask Alexa to turn the light off once u are there. As long as it is a reasonable distance of course. I admit it is a bit pricey so one should really look at their possible uses because I could see the novelty wearing off for some but for me it is a keeper.",5.0

Alexa is great for the capabilities she has, but the skills are limited so far so I recommend looking into capabilities or plan on programming your own.

I have a Philips Hue setup in my home, and it's nice to just ask for a certain lamp or set of lamps to turn on, off, dim or brighten. Saves me a trip to the lightswitch!The bluetooth speaker functionality seems spotty, as I have it connecting to my PC and it will arbitrarily disconnect, whereas other bluetooth speakers within about the same radius will connect and stay on.Aside from that, it's rather like having your phone handy and constantly listening to you, so you need not pull it out and ask for your appointments (or make them), and other things you might be used to doing with the Google Voice feature (or Siri).",4.0

I have a variety of automated home devices, such as Philips Hue bulbs, and wanted to see if the Echo would help me control everything.I now use the Echo all the time for lights, alarms, and daily news. The best part of the Echo is its ability to recognize multiple voices at different volumes. My parents also use it and have been considering getting one for their home!The best app to use with Alexa is IFTTT. You can have IFTTT add things to Google lists and calendars, trigger find your phone, create custom light settings for smart bulbs, and even set up an emergency trigger to text a loved one in an emergency. These features are all great for me since I live by myself. I definitely feel more secure being able to contact help if something should ever happen. Echo skills also expand the use of Alexa by adding trivia games, recipe apps, and searching for hotels, flights, and movies. One of my favorites is Milo, which allows you to search for movies or tv and find where it is offered on multiple services like Netflix, Hulu, etc.The only downside I have found is you have to be very specific with some commands, such as which music service you want to access or triggering IFTTT. But Amazon has recently updated the Alexa settings with the ability to change Spotify to your default music player, so a lot of the specificity is no longer needed!If you have connected home devices or live by yourself I would definitely recommend the Echo!

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","First and foremost the Echo is a good Bluetooth/connected speaker. It's no Sonos but I wasn't expecting it to be. It's really cool to ask her questions like you would a real person and get some good results. ""When is the cubs game/how are they doing"" and ""What are show times for Star Trek: Beyond"" yielded great results. To be honest though that novelty while very good and consistent wears off a little. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't invested in smart home tech because that is where the Echo shines. I currently have an Ecobee3, Phillips Hue, Sonos, August lock, and Harmony Hub. Right now the Echo works with Hue, Sonos, and Ecobee3 with the Harmony Hub being tested currently. There is no way to make the August work but there are ways to make other things work using apps like IFTT and Yonomi. I suggest anyone who wants one of these google those two apps to see some of the amazing things you can do with this awesome little device. I can turn on and off my lights, turn on and off my different activities with Harmony, play music, lower or raise the temperature and get basic info off the web. It's really cool and we are closer to Star Trek than ever. It is worth the money if you want to talk to your house. I love it. There are some failings. It doesn't understand some complex wordy questions while others it has no problem with. The list of compatible devices are limited but with those two apps I spoke of, IFTT and Yonomi that list is greatly increased, and the ""skills' you can get aren't good at all. Limited and poor. But the potential is there and it looks like Amazon is working on it.",4.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,",I originally got the Amazon Tap. I had read the reviews that mentioned that the sound was hollow with no bottom. That was correct. I returned it got the Echo and there is a big difference. The only problem is that it does not have portable power pack. I have seen 3rd party source and I'm gonna try it.I highly recommend this item. It is all that it claims.,5.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","I'm in love with my new echo. I own a multitude of wireless Bluetooth speakers that I have used in my garage while working for years. Simply comparing audio quality, I prefer the echo over my UE boom, which was my absolute favorite until this point. It doesn't have quite the bass the boom does, but it makes up for it in clarity, volume and bass responsiveness. Other than being a great speaker on its own, it's a fantastic task companion. The echo is set with every normal task you would ever need, and then some. I would happily buy another if anything were to ever happen to this one.",5.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","I bought a new mobile phone at BBY, and got a $150 gift card as part of the purchase, so bought the ECHO kind of on a whim. I am not a huge technophile, so I wasn't expecting to really love it.Setup was ridiculously easy. Connected to wifi, then connected to Amazon, Spotify, and Google Calendars accounts. Now its all voice commands for questions, music, and my girls love asking Alexa for a joke. I also connected it to my WEMO switches and it works well. I am still learning the different things I can ask her.I almost gave it four stars, because it takes a little getting used to with regards to which questions you can ask, or how to phrase a command for the best result. But in the end I decided for five stars because I am fine-tuning the app settings and preferences to make the experience better.",5.0

Amazon Fire Tv,,,","Have you ever thought...make sure to add this (t.p., eggs, shampoo, whatever) to the grocery list? With Alexa, I can just say ""Echo (which is what we named ours), add shampoo to the shopping list"" Voila! It is added to the list, which is then accessible to both myself and my husband on the app we have on our phones. I don't have to stop what I have moved onto to find the list, something to write with..you get the picture. Same thing for the to do list. We also have it connected to lamps which is ideal for my Mother who is wheelchair bound and can't reach switches. She just says, ""Echo, turn on sofa lamp"" and Voila! the light is on.",4.0
