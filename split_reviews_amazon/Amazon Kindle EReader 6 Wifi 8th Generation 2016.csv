0,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.,3.0

3,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)","I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last.",5.0
4,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Solid entry level Kindle. Great for kids. Gifted for a kid of my friend and they love to use it to read more than their iPads. battery is good but higher model is a bit better.,5.0

6,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)","I ordered this for my daughter, as I have the black paperwhite, and I love it. I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down, or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback, with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere. Its light weight, easy to use, the battery life lasts for weeks, which makes it an all around awesome device. My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers, so she can now download books for free from school! You can also download your own public library app (if your county offers that) and read free from there as well. You can shop for e-books straight from the device through Amazon.com.",5.0

20,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)","I was looking for a kindle whitepaper. I saw online for $80. What a deal. I ordered it on line and picked it up in the store. I got it home and couldn't adjust the brightness. After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service. After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesn't speak english well I figured I would just return it. Although it looks Identical to the $120 model, you can not adjust the brightness. That would have been good information before I bought it.",1.0
21,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",This is a nice bare-bones reading device. Easy to set up and use. My greatest issue is that it isn't back lit so it can't be used w/o a light on in the room. Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead.,4.0

29,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)","I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes.

53,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)","I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet.",5.0

61,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)","We got the Kindle for our daughter who accompanied us to try out the two Kindle models. We were willing to buy either one and we assumed she would want the more expensive one with the backlighting feature. But as she tried both, she gravitated with certainty toward the basic model. ""Why would U want to read in the dark?"" She said. As the weeks and months have gone by, she says she's completely happy with the basic Kindle, it's exactly what she wanted. Perfect.",5.0

67,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)","Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.",5.0

70,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant.,1.0
