Amazon Kindle Fire 5ft USB to Micro-USB Cable (works with most Micro-USB Tablets),,,",Alexa is very good a quickly satisfying your music requests. The whole interface is novel and interesting to use and for guests who have not encountered Alexa previously. Sound quality is good but not top shelf. I purchased one for our son and son-in-law for Fathers Day. Finally about 3 weeks ago we bought one for ourselves. Net: worth purchasing.,4.0
