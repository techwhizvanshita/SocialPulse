25885,Amazon Kindle Replacement Power Adapter (Fits Latest Generation Kindle and Kindle DX) For shipment in the U.S only,"I was initially happy that my Kindle replacement charging cord arrived so promptly, it seemed to work fine. But after only one use, the outer covering of the cord started cracking falling off in bits. It now is almost completely covered by electrical tape, as the bits fall off w/ each every use. I will end up having to buy a new one after all...",1.0
25886,Amazon Kindle Replacement Power Adapter (Fits Latest Generation Kindle and Kindle DX) For shipment in the U.S only,I bought the Kindle when I was in the USA but on my return to Australia I discovered I left the power adapter behind in my condo in the USA. For some reason Amazon cannot or will not mail a replacement cable to Australia so now I'm unable to re-charge my Kindle as the Micro USB cables available in Australia do not fit the Kindle as it is tiny compared to the ones available here.I would say this is one huge draw-back of this particular USB power adapter.Other than that it works great to re-charge the Kindle.Luckily I do have some friends in the US and one of them is willing to mail the replacement cable to me in Australia. Hopefully this will work out OK or else I will have no choice but to wait until I get back to the US at the end of the year.,5.0
25887,Amazon Kindle Replacement Power Adapter (Fits Latest Generation Kindle and Kindle DX) For shipment in the U.S only,"I purchased my Kindle2 in March of 09 - and it came with this adapter and cord. It is now October 09, and the small part of the adapter for this cord has stopped working. Fortunately, I was able to plug the CORD part into my laptop's USB port, and charge the Kindle that way. While plugged into a wall socket using Amazon's adapter, it does not charge at all (no light, no charge, no nothin'). I tried using the USB/Power adapter for my iPod, but the charge light blinked intermittently, and it seemed to drain the Kindle's battery. I have only had this for 9 months. I think the adapter should last longer than that. Preferably, Amazon could/should have come up with an interface that allows the use of adapters we already have - like for our phones or iPods. It's not rocket science... but it IS marketing. I came online to purchase the replacement, but I'm not sure I want to buy the same thing.... I have both the original Kindle and the Kindle2, and I love the product, but with this adapter, I have to ask.... Why",2.0
25888,Amazon Kindle Replacement Power Adapter (Fits Latest Generation Kindle and Kindle DX) For shipment in the U.S only,"Can someone explain to me why I can find hundreds and hundreds of people with this disintegrating isulation on charging cord problem, but not ONE post from Amazon with an official Company Statement about these defective, inferior, slave-labor built, imported, crap charging cablesAnyoneI'll be you dollars to donuts that these 100s of complains will bloom into 10s of thousands, as the existing, bad cables mature. (dry out, degrade, undergo radioactive decay, whatever their issue is). I'll bet I'll win!",1.0
