8369,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,"These Amazon batteries did the job although I gave 4star only because I had a few I would say a hand full of batteries that were not as strong or were pretty weak but out of a box of 48 batteries, I will definitely buy again for this priceIm pretty well satisfied.Thank you!",4.0

8373,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity.",1.0
8374,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,The 48 packs are the lowest price per AA battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new AA batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not fooling with recharging every night is worth it to me.,5.0

8379,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,"AmazonBasics AA batteries save me a lot of time and money going to the store and buying them pack by pack, it is very cost efficient to but these for my budget friendly family of 5.I love that this is a big pack of batteries, 20 in all making the price drop down to about .38 cents a battery. I use these in everyday things from remotes, to flash lights. They work just as good as the more expensive batteries saving me lots of cash.I turn to the AmazonBasics brand when it comes to all of my office needs. I can't complain about any of their products I bought so far. Now it's time to buy a big pack of AAA batteries from AmazonBasics. I highly recommend these batteries to anyone out there looking to buy a great quality pack of batteries. These are great for products that have a highly running life like babies products or toys. They defiantly can keep up with my family without wasting ton of money.",5.0
8380,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,"AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile). If/when I do additional aaa tests/reviews in the future, I will update this list.ACDelco AAA Super Alkaline BatteriesDuracell AAA Batteries Coppertop MN2400 - 20 PackDuracell Procell AAA Batteries PC2400BKD09Energizer MAX AAA BatteriesMaxell Alkaline Battery AAA CellRayovac Alkaline AAA Batteries",4.0

8443,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,When in ordered there batteries I was not sure what to expect. I must say I was pleasantly surprised.

The expiration date on these Amazon basics AAA's is 2027 so I expect them to have a good shelf life I believe these batteries will perform every bit as well as the energizers I last purchased. I took advantage of the snail mail delivery I received a 5 Amazon credit which made this deal even better.

In all the years I've been shopping here! I came across these while searching for batteries to use with my son's toys (they all take a ton) as well as for use in products around the house. I took a look at the reviews and decided they were definitely worth trying out! Of course I used my Prime shipping and they arrived in 2 days. Once they arrived we put 3 in my son's toy train and BAM! off it took with speed! Even my son said wow, the train is going faster than ever haha! I'm currently using these in his toys, the wall clock, the meat thermometer and many other items! I certainly recommend these batteries.

My son is six years-old and owns a ton of toys that require batteries. I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price.

8521,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,I love these batteries. I am so happy that I bought them. Batteries are super expensive at my local retailer. It's sad when the batteries cost more than the thing you are putting them into. I paid about the same amount to get 48... Yes 48 AA batteries from Amazon as I would have paid to get 8 from my local retailer. I needed batteries for my new game trail camera. It takes 8 AA batteries and I was fearful that I was going to go into the poor house trying to keep fresh batteries in my trail camera. I went shopping online at Amazon and found these. I bought these several weeks ago. I used 8 AA from this box in my new trail camera. I am so happy with them. My trail camera has been in the woods several weeks and the batteries are still over 90 charged and that's after taking tons of video of game. These are working great and I saved a ton of cash. I am buying a box of the AAA now. I always seem to need them around the house for some reason. I am very happy with my new batteries from AmazonBasics. They are working great for me.

10149,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,When using these batteries in a professional camera flash (high powered device) they last only 3/4 as long as a similar duracell or energizer battery but for the difference in price I recommend these.

10150,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,"It's not a high discharge battery, but for typical uses such wireless mouse and flashlights, these are great.",5.0
10151,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,"Why pay extra for Duracell batteries when AmazonBasics' batteries will last almost as long I bought a 48-pack of AA batteries for just 12 that's just 25 cents per battery! Meanwhile, Energizer Max was being sold at 14 for a 24-pack, coming out to 58 cents per battery and Duracell Coppertop was being sold at 12 for a 24-pack, coming out to 50 cents per battery. Amazon has proved the quality of its items over and over again, but I'd say they really outdid themselves this time. Ask anyone which battery brand is the best and most will answer Duracell, while some others may answer Energizer. That's because both companies, particularly Duracell, have built a solid, positive reputation as long lasting batteries, and not only do they last long, but they also survive a long period of time being stored. Some Duracell batteries even state that they'll last 10 years without being used, of which I have no doubt if any battery can last that long, it's Duracell. Nonetheless, Amazon has also created a battery that outshines most, and in most applications even outshines Duracell and Energizer. AmazonBasics batteries last a long time before having to be replaced and they come at a cheaper price than what you'll find in the dollar store, plus they look pretty cool. Obviously that last part isn't important, but it's nice to have a unique-looking battery that can be easily distinguished from all others. AmazonBasics also claims that their batteries have anti-leakage protection and can be stored for up to 10 years, just like Duracell. All three brands offer anti-leakage batteries, AmazonBasics and Duracell batteries are said to last up to 10 years in storage, and Energizer offers batteries that last up to 20 years in storage. If you want to store batteries for a decade or two, your best bet is Energizer Ultimate Lithium. If you are using batteries for important applications such as smoke detectors, although I suspect that AmazonBasics would fulfill its job, maybe stick with Duracell just because it has already proven over a long period of time the quality and consistency of its products, while AmazonBasics is still creating its name. But for pretty much everything else, from remote controls to cameras to calculators and everything similar, AmazonBasics should be your only thought when it comes to buying batteries.Here are links for what I believe are each brand's best batteries:AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48-Pack)Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA Batteries, World's Highest-Energy AA Battery, 8 countDuracell Ultra Power Aa Batteries 8 Count",5.0

10472,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,"As a rule, it's hard to tell the difference between one alkaline battery and another.

These alkaline AAs are indistinguishable from most brands.In a way, that's a shame. The copper-top Duracells make it easy to avoid putting in new batteries upside down.On the other hand, the packaging excels. Instead of a brick of loose batteries, sets of 4 batteries are shrunk together, making it easier to avoid loosing loose batteries, without consuming the space that the big cards with their bubbles consume. The 4-packs are in a corrugated cardboard box that looks llike it will last long enough for the purpose.These are enougfh batteries here to last me a long while.

The batteries came in two cellophane wraps, 20 batteries in all 10 per wrapper.The AAA batteries measure 10.22mm in diameter and 44.22mm in length. Battery imprinted with Amazon basis. The battery is mostly silver accented with a green circle with a check mark inside. One of the ends of the battery has a little protruding button and is marked with a + sign. The other side of the battery is flat and marked with a minus sign. There are several descriptions and warnings printed on the battery. One of the messages with a black background states No mercury added with a note below that says Made in Indonesia with some more writing that looks like French. Also printed on the battery is a note reading ALKALINE BATTERY and below this, AAA/LR03/AM4 followed by 1.5V. There is some Chinese symbols as well. Another warning reads- May explode or leak if recharged, disposed of in fire, short circuited, or improperly inserted. Again this is followed with French writing. Also there are other warning labels, one with a small circle that has a line thru it, a small picture of a garbage can with a line thru it, and another small circle with arrows around a E.The battery fits in my small flashlight and powers up ok, but has not been in there long enough to test the longevity of the battery.

I was just digging through the junk draw when I realized I was completely out of both AAA and AA batteries. Amazon to the rescue. Two minutes later batteries ordered and on the way. Almost everything I normally use on a daily basis (or remember using) has built in rechargeable batteries, that is until I start thinking about remotes and game controllers, the little things that are just apart of my life without actually being memorable. Well that is while they work, I remember them when they don't work. This pack of batteries last me about a year (I think, just a guess) which is perfect. I tore the top of the box and threw the entire container in the front of my junk draw. I like how the container is just cardboard, not horrible formed plastic like the last pack of batteries I had. They are also separated into three vertical partitions of 4 sets of 4 batteries wrapped in plastic. Some may find this inconvenient with the extra steps of removing the extra wrapping. I like it, I usually need batteries in pairs of 2 or groups of 4, so i can just quickly unwrap a pack and go to town. This also makes it easier to clean up if I drop the box.",5.0

However when compared to the cost, you will still come out ahead with these, at least when buying in bulk.In addition I found that Duracell batteries gave me 4 weeks with the candles I own while Rayovac gave me 3 weeks. These Amazon batteries give me 6 weeks. So they are not only a better price but longer lasting as far as slow power drain devices.I have been using these batteries now for a great deal of time and with applicable use not pretty but utterly useless conjecture.

I am one of those types who uses a volt meter to test batteries prior to installation and often when I remove them I test them to see what is left at the end of its useful life. Duracell batteries are usually a good bit higher in their new state then any other battery I have used on average. They also seem to go for longer life cycles then any other battery and go lower as far as discharge voltage goes. These batteries are the first and only ones that seem to be close to Duracell. These are a better deal as far as price per unit goes. The difference in performance is not enough to pay more for Duracell batteries.,5.0

11084,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,"I decided to give this 48 pack of AmazonBasics AA batteries a chance because with two kids I burn through batteries like crazy. First off the price was definitely better than buying even store brand batteries at a local store. It was definitely cheaper than buying brand name. I was really impressed with how they were packaged. They come in a nice little box with four batteries plastic wrapped together. I like that because the batteries stay nice and organized even once you open the package. The single packages inside are easy to open too. You just twist them and they break open so it's not like you have to grab scissors or a knife.As far as using them they work just fine. I'm no scientist so I've never sat down and done some experiment on these to track the use, but I can't tell the difference from when I was buying Duracell or Energizer or any other battery.We have used them in all kinds of kids toys, in remote controls and in our Xbox 360 controller. They seem to hold up well and I have not had any that did not work.Since I can't tell a difference in how they work or how long they last I will definitely get these since they are cheaper.

11093,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value.",3.0

I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere.

I used them on my xbox controller, but i think it soaked up more power than I thought so the batteries died with in a month or so. Its not like I keep track, but noticing the controller shutting off was what lead me on to the life of the batteries. I have enough to last me a year or so. Again, good buy.

11211,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,"I am extremely disappointed with these batteries, which stems not from longevity or power, but with fit. Almost immediately upon receiving them I installed them into three electric candles. No joy. I cleaned the contacts, still no joy. I tested the batteries, full charge. Just for grins, I installed into one candle three Ray-O-Vac brand batteries, and the candle lit with no problem. Removed the Ray-O-Vacs, installed the Amazons, and again, no joy. I repeated this a couple of times with the same results. And I tried this in the other two candles with identical results: All three candles lit with the Ray-O-Vacs, none with the Amazons. Knowing the issue was not with candles, I took a Ray-O-Vac and lined it up with an Amazon, and discovered something interesting: the batteries were just a wee bit different.The length of the positive terminals are different, just a tad longer on the Ray-O-Vac (see picture). The Ray-O-Vac terminal is taller (longer) while the Amazon terminal is squat-tier and therefore shorter. The difference in length is tiny, no question: but when you're putting batteries into a rather cheap device to start with, that tiny bit of length in this case seems to be the difference between one battery forming a sufficient connection and the other one not. I'll keep the Amazons to use in devices (mice, for example) that are likely more solidly built than these candles and have a greater connection tolerance (or a stronger spring) to hold the battery firmly in place. I am concluding that when replacing batteries in an older device (that may not force as firm a connection) or in a cheapo device that may not hold batteries tightly from the get-go, use a branded-name battery.I am a longtime and extremely satisfied user of Amazon Basic computer cables (among their first products in the Basics line), but was recently disappointed with another item I purchased outside of the computer connectors and cables line (that being dog house-training piddle pads, which have not proven as absorbent as similarly-priced products, and I've bought a lot of different brands). The batteries were my second foray into Basics product lines outside of the oh-so-dependable-cables arena, and now I'm 2 for 2 in the disappointed column. I never thought there was a difference in batteries, and now I know differently. The next time I see a Duracell commercial emphasizing reliability and dependability, I'll think back to this experience, as I will when selecting batteries in the future. I so wanted to like these Amazon batteries, too.",2.0

However, with 48 batteries, you'd think if that were the case that some of them would work well, and for me they have not. The main way these are being used are in an Xbox remote. The Xbox is only used to run Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video on our tv, so I am basically using the game remote as a TV remote. It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought. I purchased these thinking they would be a great deal. However, going through them 3x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value, not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often. I will use up the ones I already bought, then I will not be buying any more.",2.0

11587,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value.",3.0

11905,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,"I'm always in search of the best reviewed and most economical AAA batteries I can find, because we use a LOT of them. I've bought from Costco, Groupon and other online retailers.These might qualify as the longest-lasting, most economical batteries I have yet found, given that they were on sale sometime Thanksgiving and Christmas. They arrived quicker than I expected. 100 batteries, shrinkwrapped in groups of 4, all perfectly packaged in a small-but-heavy plain brown box. It was a pleasure to receive and open the box. The batteries themselves looked very plain, almost generic although they did have the AmazonBasics label on them.But that was just icing on the cake for the way these batteries performed. I use a lot of flashlights and headlamps due to age-related reduction in my visual acuity. I also use AAA operated Sennheiser headphones for listening to TV and other audio devices. These are all pretty high-draw devices and they get a lot of use.Keeping in mind that these were the first Amazon batteries I ever purchased, I monitored them pretty closely. Compared to the other batteries I bought, these are still wowing me. Previously, I swore by the Costco batteries, but so far these AmazonBasic left the Costco batteries in the dust. In the Sennheisers I've only changed the AmazonBasics batteries once since installing them almost a month ago. More typically, I have to change them out every week-and-a-half. I don't know if the difference is because the Amazon batteries are fresher or what. But the difference is most pronounced.So. Based on this one purchase, I can recommend that you at least give these a try. Maybe I was just lucky on this purchase. But the more I use them, the more impressed I am with them. I will buy these again in the future and if my opinion changes, I will update this review. Barring that, enjoy!",5.0
