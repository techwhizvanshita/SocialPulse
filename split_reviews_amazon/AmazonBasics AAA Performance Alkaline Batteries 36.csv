11,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"When I first started getting the Amazon basic batteries I really liked them. With recent purchases, they do not seem to last like they had, or maybe a mixed-bag (inconsistent with some lasting better than others).

17,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras.

39,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage.

49,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),The 48 packs are the lowest price per AA battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new AA batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not fooling with recharging every night is worth it to me.,5.0

63,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile). If/when I do additional aaa tests/reviews in the future, I will update this list.ACDelco AAA Super Alkaline BatteriesDuracell AAA Batteries Coppertop MN2400 - 20 PackDuracell Procell AAA Batteries PC2400BKD09Energizer MAX AAA BatteriesMaxell Alkaline Battery AAA CellRayovac Alkaline AAA Batteries",4.0

110,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I've been buying AAA alkaline batteries in packages of four at the dollar store and thought I was getting a pretty good deal on the price, but it bothered me to have to throw away so much packaging every time I needed four batteries. Then I was checking out a fellow reviewer's profile and found a review of the AmazonBasics AAA batteries. He (or she, I can't remember) claimed these work as well or better than name brands and are even less expensive than the dollar store deals and with much less waste in the packaging.So I ordered some and his advice was right on the money. I've used them (so far) in small flashlights and in one of my TENS machines. Great performance. The price (which seems to fluctuate) is less than I was paying locally. Best of all, you get 36 batteries in a tiny cardboard box that measures 4 1/4 x 2 1/4 x 2 1/4. There are 9 sealed packages of 4 batteries each, but there's much less waste in the packaging. Amazon claims 10-year, no-leak shelf life for them, but even I use batteries faster than that.I think this is a great product at a great price and I love the packaging. Glad I stumbled onto them.",5.0
111,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"Thats a whole lot of batteries! I ordered the 48 pack of AA batteries and its so much cheaper than a much smaller branded pack from the big chain stores. They arrived packaged well and wrapped nicely, see included pictures for details. I like to keep extra batteries around because most new electronics do not have included batteries these days. I hate getting a device in the mail and scavenging the house for batteries or stealing them from the remote controls. At this price, we can all afford to keep a bunch on hand. Ive tested these on several devices so far and they appear to be comparable to brand name batteries, they last a long time and bring all my electronics to life with renewed vigor. I'll definitely be buying more in the future.",5.0

116,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),I bought these batteries to use with a battery operated pump that transfers gas from a gas can into the tank of my riding mower. This is a far better way of fueling my mower than trying to lift a five gallon tank and trying to empty it into the mower tank. The pump uses 4 AA batteries and that is the way the Amazon batteries are packaged. Having them bundled in foursomes is convenient. My pump runs perfectly with these batteries.These batteries are said to have a shelf life of ten years so I won't be having to buy more AA batteries for at least that long. The price of these batteries is a genuine bargain and is it highly recommended to get this offer if AA batteries are needed.,5.0

I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price.

If this review helped you, click YES below. Thank you!",5.0
416,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),I love these batteries. I am so happy that I bought them. Batteries are super expensive at my local retailer. It's sad when the batteries cost more than the thing you are putting them into. I paid about the same amount to get 48... Yes 48 AA batteries from Amazon as I would have paid to get 8 from my local retailer. I needed batteries for my new game trail camera. It takes 8 AA batteries and I was fearful that I was going to go into the poor house trying to keep fresh batteries in my trail camera. I went shopping online at Amazon and found these. I bought these several weeks ago. I used 8 AA from this box in my new trail camera. I am so happy with them. My trail camera has been in the woods several weeks and the batteries are still over 90 charged and that's after taking tons of video of game. These are working great and I saved a ton of cash. I am buying a box of the AAA now. I always seem to need them around the house for some reason. I am very happy with my new batteries from AmazonBasics. They are working great for me.

You get 100 in bundles of 4 tightly wrapped in plastic, all packaged in a plain corrugated cardboard box. The price is good. The batteries are plentiful. I've read reviewer complaints here that the battery quality is inferior, that they don't work, or explode, or ooze, or don't last very long. I can't tell you about this. I don't have a battery tester and nor do I have the ambition to set up a test involving these vs. some top brands to see which work better and last longer.Don't try to charge them (duh!) and just use them. I'm not a big user of AA batteries and now that the World As I Knew It is coming to an end, there will probably be plenty of these still in my house when that end arrives.",4.0

601,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),Be Careful with this one - I put 4 of these into my TV remote and almost immediately had one pop. I could hear a sizzling sound within the remote and I immediately took out the battery carrier (I inserted them in proper polarity).

610,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I prefer purchasing my batteries in bulk, so that I can buy them once and forget about them for the upcoming months (or year). AmazonBasics was, at the time of purchase, the most economical pack of AAA batteries.I haven't noticed any difference in time or quality of use. I don't use AAA batteries for many things, though, and for those that I do the items tend to last for quite some time on a pair of batteries, so I would not notice a change unless the batteries were really, really poor quality. Thankfully, they're not, and their price point made them a steal for me. These also store well - I have had no issues using some of these that my parents purchased years ago and they appear comparable to the pack I purchased recently.I've lately been really impressed with the quality of electronics that AmazonBasics offers.

611,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"These Amazon AA batteries are better than other leading brands like Duracell or Energizer compared within the Alkaline category.

I'm not sure about shelf life though as I never put aside a battery for that many years and tried it before, but I do believe these can last way longer than the other brands. From experience, I feel that these out last longer than others with normal usage. The shiny coating looks better than the white coat before. The price for a pack of these is also the best value than going to any actual store to buy them as they tend to be expensive. So far, every one of these batteries worked just fine with full charges and no dead ones at all. Very satisfied and happy I made this purchase.",5.0

Type 1 diabetes is expensive in itself and I'm glad that I can save, even if it's just spare change, on the products I need to purchase to keep my insulin pump going. I find that these last just as long as name-brand batteries and have had no problems with them.

653,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"We normally buy CostCo batteries, so we don't by the Top brand anyway. It's a question of value. If the top brand lasts to a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the best, longest lasting, battery life, and these only last to a 7 or 8 they are a great value anyway because they are 100 batteries for 22.

666,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"What I found was that in our Wii controllers and Xbox controllers, the rechargeable packs would die after a few months (maybe last a year)...but then I would have spent so much on the packs that I wouldn't want to replace them, so they would stay in the charger longer and longer and when we wanted to play a game, we only got 10 minutes of play time until the rechargeable pack was dead.Then I bought batteries at Walmart (Duracell) and used those...but it was so long between changes that when we wanted to play a game 6 months later, only half the controllers worked! And I was out of batteries!Then I got an Amazon Dash button for these and now all that is gone. I put the box of batteries downstairs by the Xbox and Wii. No more dead batteries!!!!

They arrived and I put them to the test since apparently all gizmos and gadgets require like 4 of these bad boys.I can not even describe how pleasantly surpised I was with these.

Candles and flashlights were so dim I would have required more of them than I am physically capable of carrying to avoid tripping over my own feet. None of the appliance remotes would even turn their respective appliances on after these batteries were inserted. Every item I tried these batteries in also stopped working completely due to a dead battery in less than 30 minutes.Obviously, I should have returned these batteries, and I'm sure I would have done so if my mom had not had a heart attack shortly after I received them.

Only in China can they still pack in cardboard boxes that surround the package like this.I am not doing any testing, other than use in low powered items like wireless mice, keyboards, wall clocks and the like. That's all I need them for. These cells meet those requirements and that's all I care about. For high volume stuff I use NiMHs, but you just can't beat the price. I am finding that many of the Amazon basics products are a hit. I have bought several things and all have worked just as good or better than the higher priced competition. Good job Amazon.",5.0

1120,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I've used these as a replacement for the nearly double in price of Duracell batteries. These last just as long as the Duracell batteries - a minute or two does not make a difference as my devices are on 24/7 - especially when these batteries are half the price! I have not had any leak, whether they were in their package or in any devices. The expiration dates on every shipment I've had so far have averaged 9 years with some 10 years from when I received them. This means they are fresh (recently made) and haven't been sitting around on a warehouse shelf for long. I like the green circular negative (-) indicator with the check mark (tick) on the side. Makes for quick installation in poor light. Excellent value and excellent performance!",5.0

You are not going to find a better deal for high quality, reliable alkaline batteries anywhere.",5.0
1122,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"Like most people I use tons of batteries. The super high price and hassle of the marketing and nomenclature of buying them at the store is removed by buying these Amazon battery packs. More and more I am realizing that when possible it's a good idea to go with the 'Amazon Basics' products (especially for items like batteries). Certainly there are premium batteries that I have trusted for years and will continue to purchase. But I have found no difference between these Amazon batteries and my favorite other brands. So instead of buying 2 or 5 packs of batteries while waiting to check out in the store think about getting a realistic quantity of excellent batteries for half the price (maybe not half, but certainly less than name brands).",5.0

1126,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I have used inexpensive dollar store batteries in the past. I became curious about the actual performance data of cheap vs. name brand batteries, and discovered that essentially you pay approximately the same amount per unit of power, regardless of battery (with the exception of lithium ion which cost more per unit of power). Also, I noticed that the cheap batteries did not work as well as name brand with my automatic wine bottle opener. So, if I am going to pay the same amount of unit power per battery, why not get the ones I have to change the leastI was pleasantly surprised to find these amazon basics batteries at a cost per battery that is significantly lower than name brands, but with similar performance characteristics as the name brands. Assuming the marketing information is accurate, these batteries should last a long time, and not cost much. This is an ideal combination in my opinion.",5.0

1152,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"With some reservations these appear to be excellent batteries. I replaced some Duracell batteries in several LED flashlights with these and the light was much brighter with Amazon batteries (side by side testing, two identical flashlights). I am impressed. On the down side, the date (I supposed expiration date of shelf life) is almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass. It is very readable on Duracell batteries. These were 2025 dated, so obviously they are 10 years out, and that's very good, will surely use them up long before then. The packaging is simple, but more or less necessitates a container to store them as they will just fall all over the drawer once opened. In hard to read print on the batteries it says made in Indonesia. Not Japan as some reviews had thought might be the country of origin. BTW -- the Duracells AAA's I removed from my flashlight leaked badly and ruined the (expensive) flashlight. Therefore I am sticking with Amazon batteries for now.",5.0

It's important to me that if we're spending our hard earned money that we get a top notch product in return. I often rely on the reviews and opinions of others when contemplating purchasing a new product that I haven't tried before myself. Because of that, any products that I buy (whether on Amazon or from a 3rd party) I always make sure to leave a detailed review of the product to help others when selecting items to purchase, as well. My family tests these products fully before forming a solid opinion and writing a review.

4601,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"As a rule, it's hard to tell the difference between one alkaline battery and another. Pull the Duracells out, and put in Everyready Alkaline Energizer, and you won't notice any difference in performance. Fifty years ago, freshness was a big factor, but alkaline has a long shelf life. These alkaline AAs are indistinguishable from most brands.In a way, that's a shame. The copper-top Duracells make it easy to avoid putting in new batteries upside down.On the other hand, the packaging excels. Instead of a brick of loose batteries, sets of 4 batteries are shrunk together, making it easier to avoid loosing loose batteries, without consuming the space that the big cards with their bubbles consume. The 4-packs are in a corrugated cardboard box that looks llike it will last long enough for the purpose.These are enougfh batteries here to last me a long while.

The only reason they didn't get 4 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand. As the battery ages, it gets weaker. It lasts about as long as a normal Duracell or Energizer, but the output drops significantly as the product ages. They are great for remote controls, smoke detectors, etc. Not advisable for anything with moving parts or motors.",4.0

4824,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"So, I purchased a pack of these a month ago (11-Dec-2015) and was using them as expected, when I hit a snag. At LEAST 3 batteries from this pack were marginal/undervoltage (1.5V) out of the box. I found this out because I had replaced a pair of batteries in one of my remote sensors for my wall mounted indoor weather station because the had sensor stopped working. I thought maybe I had inserted them wrong, but no, the +/- marks matched the batteries. So I tried several times to reset both the sensor and the station with no luck. At one point, I had all of the batteries out to force a reset and put them back. But now my weather station would not power up either.That was the clue I needed. I got my trusty multimeter (with battery tester) and checked out all 5 of the Amazon Basics AA cells. Like all NEW 1.5V batteries, most of them showed 1.6V which is typical. Two of them were at 1.48V, which was just low enough for them to be considered undervoltage. No new AA battery should arrive with 1.5V. This is the first and only time I have ever seen fresh batteries arrive in a not as new condition with caused problems with my electronics.I generally like all of the various Amazon Basics products (mice, HDMI cables, etc.), but this has caused me to have doubts about not only their AA batteries, but all of the house branded products.

I marked off one star because I don't believe they have lasted as long as the Energizer batteries I used previously, but it is not a big difference. I have been using these primarily to power a head lamp with band that I wear at work at night time out in the field. They provide the same brightness as the energizers but my light seemed to start getting dimmer a little sooner than with the energizers.

I purchased these for the company, but I was so impressed with them that I purchased these batteries in AAA, AA and D on my personal Amazon account for home use and paid the same for a bulk package of 48 as I would have for an 8 pack of name brand batteries. They come in a sturdy cardboard box that comes in handy for neatly storing them. Amazon also printed the size of the batteries on the side of the box, making it easy to just grab the ones you need. Never again will we be asking each other if we have any (insert size) batteries and if so, where are they...or even worse, having to borrow a battery from one device to work another!",5.0
5224,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),I am a Duracell fan. I am one of those types who uses a volt meter to test batteries prior to installation and often when I remove them I test them to see what is left at the end of its useful life. Duracell batteries are usually a good bit higher in their new state then any other battery I have used on average. They also seem to go for longer life cycles then any other battery and go lower as far as discharge voltage goes. These batteries are the first and only ones that seem to be close to Duracell. These are a better deal as far as price per unit goes. The difference in performance is not enough to pay more for Duracell batteries.,5.0

If you need a sizeable number of batteries at once, this deal is hard to beat.They're all meticulously packed in 4-cell wrappers, so you won't have 100 batteries rattling around and tipping over in a jumbled mess.

5289,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"Great deal- don't waste any more money buying batteries at the store! You can't beat the price and they work and lask as well as brand name batterys. It it amazing how much cheaper these are- and you get twice as many. I got these in AA, AAA, C and D. The main reason I even bought them was when I was looking for flashlight batteries- size D for my trusty maglight (yes they are heavy but I love them for it, they are perfect for a car and the weight keeps it steady if you have to put it down) and size C for a different flashlight. Of course I needed an odd number and couldn't believe how expensive they were in the store. I checked Amazon- had no clue amazon had their own batteries and noticed that in all of the sizes- the price was less then the smallest pack of that size in the store and had twice as many batteries. Did I need this many AAA batteries at the time- nope but let me tell you I'm so glad I got extra- less than a week after buying them I had already nearly used every one. I went around the house and replaced every remote and device I could find and they work great! With AA and AAA size I'd recommend buying a bigger pack- yes it does seem like a lot of batteries at first but trust me you'll be glad you got extra- it's one of those items every house needs and easily gets overlooked.",5.0

5847,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"These batteries are high quality and inexpensive. I bought this pack to primarily use in toys like nerf guns. I was slightly concerned about buying a brand that I had never used before especially for a birthday party (even if it has Amazon's name on it).When I opened the package, I was pleasantly surprised. They have a decent weight to them. This is generally how you can tell the difference between cheap batteries and high-quality batteries. The heavier they are the liner they will last.After using these batteries for a Nerf battle birthday party to power large Nerf guns and throughout Christmas, I'm hooked. I have enrolled in a Subscribe and Save plan on Amazon which allows for an additional discount to have them delivered periodically.I would definitely recommend these batteries to anyone for whatever battery needs they may have.

5859,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I ordered these mainly to use in a set of small LED flashlights.

I tried them in a different device didn't work in that either. Amazon sent me a second set free of charge. They still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy.

5862,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),Not lasting very long. I read the reviews and expected better life out of these batteries. In comparison to Duracell they seem to last about 75 as long. I find that both the AA and AAA are sub-par in longevity. Perhaps that is the way I use them but I really expected more.,3.0

5873,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"Very unhappy with these batteries. Used them for my flame-less candles, 3 batteries in each.

5874,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I suppose the most honest thing about them is in their name...BASIC!! I use them in my blood pressure monitor. I take my BP twice a day and it only takes about 10 seconds. The batteries only last about 6 weeks. I've also used them in my air conditioner remote which I might use once or twice a day, just to turn it on or off. Again, after about 5 - 6 weeks, they stop working. They are also used in my Alexa/Echo remote which is used more often, yet, they last about 3 months in it. This is the first Amazon labeled/made product that I have bought that was not rated a 5.

5880,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),I actually like them I see some people saying they don't like them but they actually work really good for me. I use them for my xbox one controller I play a lot. the first ones I used lasted pretty long I can't tell you how long exactly but it had to be around 6 or 7 days playing for about 3 sometimes 4 hours a day so I'd say that's pretty good. Im using my second ones now still pretty good so 5 stars all the way for me,5.0
5881,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I always put new batteries in my three thermostats at the beginning of the heating season in late Sept to make sure they work through the winter.

5886,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I posted an entire review about the C batteries but I will reiterate here. I was once scared of the generic battery. I was scared that if I did not use the name brand, super expensive battery that I would be doing a disservice to whatever toy or electronic I was putting them in. This is not the case with these batteries. I know that there are batteries out there that are generic and have not worked as well but I am here to vouche for these batteries. I have been using them in everything and bought all the different kinds because of how well they worked and the value. The value for this amount of batteries and the quality of these batteries cannot be beat anywhere else. They have outlasted the expensive kinds in my daughters toys and in the things that I have placed them in around the house. I have not been disappointed and I was floored by the price. I do not mean to prattle on but I cannot say enough about these toys. As it gets closer to Christmas, parents all around are stocking up on batteries, I know I am. I have bought a pack of AAA, AA, and C just for Christmas. I could not believe the savings and you will not be disappointed with the quality. I am now an advocate for Amazon batteries.

5920,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),I had ordered these because the Duracell batteries I ordered did not hold up during storage. I found that these batteries had a longer running time and so far they are holding up during storage. The Duracell batteries broke and became corroded. This is dangerous to anyone.

I threw out 5 batteries one day, and found 3 more that were in use in remotes that needed to be thrown out as well because they had leaked, and had to throw out a remote as well since it had corroded inside.I'm not going to be buying again.

I've done this for several years, I usually change the batteries out about every 6 weeks, these lasted about 7 weeks. I know that's not the typical scientific review you see from some with how many volts after how many hours, but I'm just giving you a real world review, these are just as good, if not better, than the name brand batteries I purchased in the past.

5941,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I like the heavy card board box they come in. The strength (AAA, AA, C, etc) is printed on the side of the box. This gives you the ability to stack your batteries in a common 'emergency equipment' location so you know where to go when you need one. With the plainly marked sides, you can instantly see which box you want. This will gladly replace our current system: open a package of batteries, take 1 or 2, then put the rest back - someplace.

5993,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"Until lately 99 of the AA and AAA batteries I bought were Duracell brand. Its not that Ive found any brand to be that much better or that much worse than another but I tend to stick with what works for me. And for those things that I use disposable batteries in (I try to use rechargeables whenever I can) Duracells seem to work out the best. And they are the brand that the membership store sells so I can get them at a reasonable price whenever Im shopping for supplies.I took a chance on buying Amazon Basics brand for a couple of reasons. One is that Ive had good luck with the Amazon Basics brand I dont think Amazon is going to mess up their reputation selling junk. One strong factor is that these claim to be made in Japan, and Japanese-made batteries from Panasonic, Sony, Maxell and other major name brands have a good reputation. But the 1 reason I tried these is price. They are 10-15 cents less PER BATTERY than what Ive been buying and it doesnt make sense to me to pay more if Im not getting any more.These have an overall feeling and look of being made pretty well. Its easy to spot a cheap no-name battery and these are definitely better. They are bulk packed, which is great, why pay more for fancy packaging on something as mundane as a battery And theyre fresh you know thats going to be true with Amazons immense daily turnover of product. If you are reading the reviews, be aware that Amazon has been making regular upgrades to this battery, so something reviewed a year ago is probably long obsolete by now. The biggest change I understand is the shelf life of the newest formulation is now rated at 10 years. I dont really care, theres no way a box of batteries is going to sit on my shelf for 10 years but it does mean that when I get to the 48th battery out of a package of 48 it probably will be nearly as fresh as the first one in the pack.I havent been able to see any downsides, and I do like saving money that would be wasted for fancy packaging and expensive advertising, so unless something drastically changes I believe these will now be my brand of choice.",4.0

5998,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money.

These AAA batteries are just another example of Amazon's buying power and smart branding. Because why would any company put their name (and reputation) on a product if they weren't convinced that it would be a true value to consumers The last thing that they want consumers to do is identify Amazon with anything but quality.So buy these knowing that they are a good value and work properly. And if for some reason you get a bad batch--which can happen to anyone--simply return them under their return policy and get a replacement box.,5.0

6176,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn't unlock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren't all created equal.",1.0
6177,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I purchased a box of these. First replacement for my outdoor weather info transmitter didn't work so well. Within a couple of days the receiver wasn't receiving a signal from the transmitter, so I changed out the batteries once again. Within 96hrs the receiver once again showed low battery power coming from the transmitter and wouldn't display a temperature reading. This week I'll replace those again (3rd time in 6wks) and expect a low-battery warning just days after. Unsure if I should demand an exchange or full reimbursement. Maybe they do well in warm temps, but in the cold temps they cannot perform like a Duracell or Energizer.",2.0

6180,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"Last less than a quarter as long as even off-brand batteries such as Rayovac, creating a lot more waste. With name brand batteries my wireless keyboard would last almost a year these amazon branded batteries last only 2-3 months. If they weren't considered hazardous waste when spent I might have given them 2 stars on account of there low price, but when you consider how hard it is to dispose of batteries properly (and how much time you'll spend changing them out of your favorite devices) they're really not worth your time",1.0

6186,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"Everyone debates how long batteries last and these work perfectly fine. As a college student who spends a ton of time playing Xbox, my roomates and I went through batteries by the dozen and were always short. Instead of taking them out of any device we coud get our hands on (remotes, calculators, etc) we decided to just get these in bulk. They are much cheaper than getting anything in store and last long enough that we didnt notice a difference.

So many, in fact, that I have kept them on my monthly subscribe save. Previous to trying the Amazon Basic brand I had used Duracell Maxell. As both of the former increased their prices, I decided to try the Amazon brand. I actually expected a generic performance but was happily mistaken when they lasted as long as the name brands One of my children is special needs and has an electronic keyboard that uses 6 AA batteries. With Duracell, we got about 15 hours of use, Maxell was about 14.5 and with Amazon Basic I am getting just over 15. AmazonBasics are my new battery brand",5.0

I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaked all over the compartment.Just NOW, while typing on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the heck it was that came out of the battery.I'm throwing these away and will never trust this brand again.",1.0

6212,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),Half the box did not work and one set of 4 started leaking white battery acid within 5 minutes of putting it my sons toy. Asking Amazon for a full refund.,1.0
6213,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined.,1.0
6214,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I've kept a stock of these batteries for about a year (in a drawer in my living room) and used them in my air freshener with no problems.

6217,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I bought this product from amazon about a month ago, the reviews seemed great so I gave them a try.After using the batteries in my Xbox One controllers for about 2 weeks, the controller began to malfunction.Upon further inspection, I checked the batteries, and the compartment was a little bit wet, so I cleaned it up and went to get new batteries (still in the plastic wrapper) and all of the batteries had an oily residue around them (some type of leakage) .Overall, dont save money here as you might lose your equipment and the money you spend on the batteries.",1.0
6218,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Mom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/durability.",2.0
6219,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"These batteries are the worst of any I've ever bought. They have corroded inside of toys, remotes, noise cancelling range headphones and an expensive gun scope that I own. I've tried AA and AAA, and even gave them multiple chances. The batteries in some electronic devices die within 24hrs. So needless to say, I have switched back to standard Duracell batteries.

The price can't be beat, even cheaper than Costco at the time of purchase and with free shipping in hassle free packaging.",5.0
6223,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),I just wanted to comment that I feel the individual 4-pack packaging is unnecessary.

I used them on my xbox controller, but i think it soaked up more power than I thought so the batteries died with in a month or so. Its not like I keep track, but noticing the controller shutting off was what lead me on to the life of the batteries. I have enough to last me a year or so. Again, good buy.

I used these to replenish all my kids' talking/lightup toys...as those toys don't generally work well with rechargables. I'm going to buy more of these as needed!,5.0

6502,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"Amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery. I liked it very much the last year, but the new one has a different look, has noticeably lower capacity, and leaks. Batteries usually leak after they die, but these leaked while they were still good... and apparently died because of the leak. All of my devices have battery monitored One day they were good with 50-90 power left, and they died suddenly the next day. The leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discoloration.One thing that has not changed from before is the packaging, and it is still bad. They are shrink-wrapped 4 in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cut-out or pull-tab to break the wrap. It is difficult to break open by hand. Twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak. I have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package.",2.0

Not to mention, I have 2 controllers (one has a grip), so I switch between them often. This means they should last longer since I'm not just draining the battery life on one of them.

6580,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),I have bought these several times thinking they were great but after longer term use have found they fail about twice as fast as Duracell. I will never buy them again and will not hold Amazon Basic in such A high standard. my next batteries will be Duracell,1.0
6581,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"What's happened to batteries Duracell use to be the gold standard, until we had over 10 of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year. Costco batteries became our go-to batteries until last year 2015 when they started leaking, even on the shelf. Tried Eveready but price and quality varies as well. I trusted Amazon and love the price, packaging, convenience and no leaks. But they don't last half the time the others have. Some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very, very well. And yes, we have some high current draw uses. But as my staff and Doctors have said to me: They're just batteries! Get us some decent batteries already! We go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but, paying top dollar still doesn't seem to save equipment or increase the usage time. It seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic AA batteries to your specific use. Not cool!!",1.0

6587,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion.

While the non-rechargeable batteries do not measure in mAh, these Amazon Basic ones are very much comparable in every way. I found this to be extremely interesting since I have yet to see non-rechargeable batteries perform so well.

That is, they come out of their protective wrap looking brand new but would leak within days. They fouled up a few things, one of which was a good work flashlight.

Most of them did not have any power in them. The few that did work lasted maybe an hour. I pitched the remaining 6 because I cannot depend on them at this point.

6784,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I didnt like it from the begining because it isnt very ergomatic. It was easy to hit the wrong button shocking your dog when it was last set to vibrate. It was veru easy to push buttuns so you cant put it in a pocket. Then a week into use while replacing a probe, I hand turned to tighten it and the prope broke with the scew end broke off level and no way to get it out. I bought a product that had a different control style (so many manufators use the same controler design) and i hsve no problems with handling this one. Another problem is that the reciever can be shook off the collar the more it is worn. We lost the reciever after a few weeks.

In the soap-dispenser, they lasted three weeks. I thought the dispenser must be faulty, switched them out. Next set of these batteries lasted a week. In the LED lights, the batteries lasted five hours. Less in the toys and tap lights. At this rate, I'll have used the whole box of 20 batteries in less than 6 months.

There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.",4.0

6941,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I am not a bettery expert nor an electrician. There are a few things that I consider when shopping for a battery - shelf life, price and brand. When you buy a brand product, you are most certainly guaranteed a good long lasting battery. Hence I always bought energizer or Duracell. Amazon is also a big brand so I decided to give it a try and to be honest with you it's a great battery. Price wise, it's cheaper than other name brands. One other andvreallyninportant factor is the shelf life. This battery has a shelf life of ten years, while a lot of batteries have 5 year shelf life. This is important for someone who uses batteries on a less frequent basis, such as for remote control. I started using batteries more frequently since I have a ton of baby toys now and a lot of them require batteries.One thought that came to mind while I was writing this review is that I just wanted to share a quick and easy way to check if battery is dead or not. All you need to do is hold the battery over flat surface (let's say kitchen countertop) at one or so inches high and drop it vertically on the flatter side. If it drops and falls over it is dead. If it falls and stays vertical it is still good to go. A friend of mine told me this trick and it totally works!",5.0

6949,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I really wanted to love the Amazon AA batteries but they just are not durable enough for my usage. As a night time long distance runner, I have LED headlamps with a rear red flashing light that I use which require 3 AA batteries.I usually purchase Duracell or Energizer batteries in bulk and they have worked well. Rechargeable batteries are not very good in LED Headlamps so those are out.The problem with the Amazon batteries is that I get about 8 or 9 hours of strong light, then it really fades fast. The longest I have used the Amazon batteries is 11 hours and by then, the light is less than 40 brightness. The other issue I noticed with these batteries is that the front headlight will lightly flash in time with the rear light once the front brightness is reduced. When I test the batteries with a tester, they are only 1/2 way through the green range.Duracell and Energizers give me nearly 16 - 18 hours at full brightness and maybe 3 or 4 hours with 40. I have not seen the light flashing when the brightness drops on the these batteries. When I test the batteries after the light is reduced, they are in the yellow or red area.The Amazon Batteries give me two less than the Energizers and Duracells which is significant. I average 5 night time runs with the Duracells and Energizers and 2, sometimes 3 with Amazon Batteries.These may be perfect in remote controls and other static use devices, but if it has to drive a light or a motor, you may want to skip these.The light pictures show new, 5 and 9 hours.The 2nd light shows new and 4 hours.The battery tester shows new, 4, 8 and 11 hours.",3.0

7068,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I purchased plastic battery storage cases for the batteries I had been purchasing that came on a flat piece of cardboard covered by a plastic lid. When I lifted the plastic to get a battery, other batteries tumbled out and soon I had a mess in my battery drawer. However, Amazon's batteries are very special from the minute you receive it. They arrive in a small cardboard box that just fits in your hand and opens easily from the top for removal of a battery or two. They will never fall out of the box and make a mess. I have not had a problem with using the batteries like I did when purchasing a brand from a big box store that carried its name -- the batteries leaked inside my TV remote control and made a white stain on the top of my entertainment center. Since I use the remote every day, the batteries were not left alone long enough for this to happen but it did. I went around the apartment removing those batteries from every item I own and did not want to be ruined, cleaned the mess inside the remote and vowed never to purchase batteries from that store again -- not even the name brands they often sell -- my revenge on the store for causing a white mark on my furniture -- a petty but satisfying act that was my small way of paying back. Amazon goes to great pains to see that its shipments come in containers that are easy for its customers to open and I appreciate that and am happy to see that they have carried that philosophy to include even small boxes containing their AmazonBasics Batteries.

We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days.

The Xbox is only used to run Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video on our tv, so I am basically using the game remote as a TV remote. It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought. I purchased these thinking they would be a great deal.

7903,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"The Amazon product line seems to have decent products. These batteries are no exception. There are many reviewers who will say these batteries are terrible, good, great, awesome, unsurpassed, etc. It seems the general consensus is these batteries are great for their intended purpose.First, I recommend you take a look at C (https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A35H8Y36S43CSG/refcmcrdppdp) review. This is a highly credible review as he put in his time and effort to test the batteries out. With that said, here are my two cents on batteries I have previously bought on Amazon:Rayovac: Smart choice for your portable digital electronics, lasting just a little less long as other leading brands. They are perfect for powering low-drain devices like clocks, radios, remote controls and low-powered flashlights. If you're looking for an affordable and reliable battery, get these. But it only works for me on 3-5 uses using my eyelash curler. These are good and cheap batteries. I use them for simple things that don't require a lot of power, such as my computer mouse. They do not last long, but for the price I pay I don't expect them to. if I want a quick battery that isn't going to cost more than a couple dollars I usually go with these.Duracell:Despite the shorter use by date (3/2021) than my recently purchased Energizer Industrial AAA alkalines (12/2026), these ProCell (Duracell) alkaline AAA cells have the highest open circuit voltage I've ever measured. I admit to being a price shopper, opting for 48 for 15 (Prime) rather than 24 for 11. If I get results similar to the ProCell AA and D cells I recently purchased, the AAA's should be good performers. Sadly, they are a too-tight fit to use in my recent Surefire Titan (flashlight) one AAA cell LED flashlight - but that is on the Surefire. I received decent life on these batteries besides using them in a flashlight (remote control car, remote, smoke alarm (7 months) and others. Good batteries for the right price.Energizer:I have used these in my mouse for my computer, my Xbox 360 Remote and my cable box remote. Part of me feels like these didn't last as long as they could have, but my mouse never gets shut off and my Xbox gets used relatively often (I'm not a gamer, but I use the system to watch movies).I read other reviews where people say that one of the sellers is selling used batteries I didn't have that experience. Mine arrived in a package that didn't seem to have been tampered with prior to shipping.I just ordered some Duracell Procell batteries. I want to see if they'll last longer than these did and they did not.Energizer Lithium:I put these batteries into all of the electronic Z-wave door locks that I own, because the Duracell alkaline batteries that I had been using were dying very quickly (they'd only last a about 2 months, and rechargeable ones would only last 3-4 weeks). The locks are very low-drain because most of the time they are just sitting there, but when you unlock or lock it uses a large burst of energy. And that's exactly the type of device that lithium batteries are recommended to be used in. I installed these about 4 months ago and they're all still showing 100 charge in my system control panel! Granted it only moves in 25 levels so it could be anywhere from 76-100, but still even if it depleted at a rate of 25 every 4 months that means they'll be good for at least 1 year before being replaced. That's about 6x longer than alkaline batteries would last, or if they live up to the claim of 8x then I'll get 16 months out of them. Either way I'll be saving a lot of time and money not having to swap out batteries every few months, I can now put it on my yearly to-do list instead.I also use the 9V batteries in my smoke detectors, and according to the specs they should only need to be changed every 10 years instead of the 2 years that I was getting with alkalines. Sure they are 5-7x more expensive (depending if you buy in bulk or not), but I'll gladly pay that price to not have to get up on a ladder in the middle of the night to swap out beeping smoke detector batteries all the time.Amazon Basics Batteries:The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand like you would get with the Energizer lithium. For the most part, they will perform like all the major brand with the exception of Rayovac. I find these last longer than then. As for regular Energizer and Duracell, I feel the difference is negligible. Some may or may not last longer than the Amazon brand while the others WILL last longer. I suppose it depends on the application they are used for.So in turn, yes I would recommend these to the typical consumer. The price is cheaper, the quality should be comparable to the rest. I would give them a try. If they are crappy then youre out a couple of bucks. Probably the same price when you decided to order the liver and onions you didnt like at so and so :P",4.0

I bought these a while ago and will be buying again. Batteries in my household go by quick. This pack of 48 is great for my needs and the batteries themselves pretty good themeslves. I'll admit that Duracell are better in terms of performance and durability but they can be expensive sometimes. I feel like energizer are also a step above these but for the price, you can't go wrong. They do last long (depending on use) and seem like a better option compared to the cheap batteries found at gas stations of dollar stores. Great purchase overall.",5.0

7912,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I've ordered these before and was very pleased. I've just recieved my second set and the quality has held steady. My 5 kids are hardcore gamers and we go through batteries faster than toilet paper, it seems. These are solid performance batteries at an excellent price. I used to buy my batteries in bulk at Costco, but they've raised their prices significantly, so I was thrilled to find these on Amazon for MUCH less. Highly recommended.",5.0
7913,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"These are hard to beat when it comes to price, but I have found that they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell.

7922,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I'm always in search of the best reviewed and most economical AAA batteries I can find, because we use a LOT of them. I've bought from Costco, Groupon and other online retailers.These might qualify as the longest-lasting, most economical batteries I have yet found, given that they were on sale sometime Thanksgiving and Christmas. They arrived quicker than I expected. 100 batteries, shrinkwrapped in groups of 4, all perfectly packaged in a small-but-heavy plain brown box. It was a pleasure to receive and open the box. The batteries themselves looked very plain, almost generic although they did have the AmazonBasics label on them.But that was just icing on the cake for the way these batteries performed. I use a lot of flashlights and headlamps due to age-related reduction in my visual acuity. I also use AAA operated Sennheiser headphones for listening to TV and other audio devices. These are all pretty high-draw devices and they get a lot of use.Keeping in mind that these were the first Amazon batteries I ever purchased, I monitored them pretty closely. Compared to the other batteries I bought, these are still wowing me. Previously, I swore by the Costco batteries, but so far these AmazonBasic left the Costco batteries in the dust. In the Sennheisers I've only changed the AmazonBasics batteries once since installing them almost a month ago. More typically, I have to change them out every week-and-a-half. I don't know if the difference is because the Amazon batteries are fresher or what. But the difference is most pronounced.So. Based on this one purchase, I can recommend that you at least give these a try. Maybe I was just lucky on this purchase. But the more I use them, the more impressed I am with them. I will buy these again in the future and if my opinion changes, I will update this review. Barring that, enjoy!",5.0

The name-brand batteries they replaced had lasted several months.In an LED flashlight, a pair of these batteries lasted exactly 2 uses before the light got dim and 3 uses before the batteries were totally dead. I'm talking about, like, less than 10 minutes of cumulative use. The previous batteries had lasted dozens of uses probably at least 3 hours of on-time.I don't know if I got a bad batch (a BIG bad batch of 48), or if I was just tricked into having the wrong expectations.

7948,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I didn't have high expectations for these batteries - inexpensive as they were. But they've managed to last at least as long as the name brand we've purchased in the past! With a 4 year old and several battery operated toys, we seemingly traded our consumption of diapers for batteries - we need to buy them by the case. Trying to keep the toys off when not in use and 'save' the batteries is a concept my 4 year old does NOT grasp. So while he's having a great time with a toy in the evening, by morning it was dead. So fresh batteries to the rescue. AmazonBasics batteries are not only cost effective, but they have a life span at least equal to previous name brand batteries we've bought.We will be buying more of these (probably a LOT more!)",5.0

8007,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),I came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing I've been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced. I've used 3 of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted 2 weeks in my mouse. The previous version usually lasted a couple months at least. It seems like in this day and age it's rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that they're actually better. I can only guess that Amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries. I guess it's time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since I'm not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors. If the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better I'll update my review to reflect that.***Edited to add on 10/12: Now that the 4th battery from this pack lasted just over 2 weeks in my mouse I will be contacting Amazon Customer Service. As I mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that I have to wonder why they changed them. I see the larger size Amazon batteries still carry the older name.,1.0

I use the remote so much as a Bluetooth, information giver etc etc etc, and guessed correctly that the AAA battery had run it's last mile. I had one battery left, inserted it and off we went.

In the past I would buy the cheap 4 packs of batteries from the 99cent store. They were decent, brand name and lasted about as long as the more expensive ones from a normal store. However, the 99cent store stopped selling the 4 packs and the 2 packs aren't worth the price and effort of making a special trip to a 99cent store. I bought a 16 pack of regular Duracell extra long life batteries at Target recently and went through those batteries just as fast as the 99cent store variety. Not okay.That's when I took to the internet. Good ol' Amazon has their own batteries for a much cheaper price What Perfect!I ordered a big ol' box of them and they truly do last as long as (or longer than) the name brand batteries I have purchased elsewhere but for a much better price.Now my nocturnal cats can play with their toys all night while I sleep and I can play Xbox until my fingers bleed, all for a better price. :D",5.0

I'll update my review if this opinion changes.UPDATE: I bought these on June 10th, 2017. On that day, I replaced the Wii remote with 2 of the batteries. Today, which is July 12, 2017, they needed to be replaced. Subsequently, I can say that these lasted just a little over a month. Note that the remote is used a lot.

8240,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you.

8241,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low.

Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !",1.0
8242,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"These are by far the WORST batteries I have ever purchased. I have previously purchased bulk batteries from other vendors. When I ran out of the previous batteries I thought would order more. When I saw that these were branded by Amazon I thought I could not lose...WRONG! As an example, when I put these batteries in a thermostat they are dead within a few days. I normally put batteries in this thermostat once a year...not every few days. 2nd Example: I put the batteries in a bluetooth mouse (normally batteries last a few months) and they are dead within a week.I don't know if I have a bad batch or what but they are TERRIBLE. Take this into account before you order.",1.0
8243,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),These batteries are the worst batteries I've ever purchased. I am in disbelief how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kids and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I've since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I'll stick to buying batteries at Costco in the future.,1.0
8244,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),What went wrong These are the worst AAA batteries I've ever purchased. Make that the worst batteries ever purchased. I've used over half of them so far and I'm getting about 25 of the life I previously got from Duracell and other brand names.,1.0
8245,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),Our experience with all Amazon batteries have been bad. They dont last nearly as long as a Duracel or Energizer.

Will not buy these again.,1.0
8246,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in.

At first I believed it was a bad batch of a four pack batteries, no problem, THEN, a week and a half has passed and I had to change the batteries for my clock FIVE TIMES! I hope this review will convince you (the reader) to never purchase these batteries, I know they are not that expensive and I shouldn't make a big deal out of it, but it is frustrating to see the seller LIE MORE THAN ONCE, took their sweet a** time to deliver it to the buyer (about a month in waiting), and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product.

I can get a good amount of use from these batteries. Of course it depends on how often and how long I use the devices but I don't notice a dramatic difference between these and higher end brand name batteries. For the price, I am happy with these. I have not had any leak and none so far have been duds. I am going with 4 stars. Not the best you can buy but certainly worth the price!",4.0

8318,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I don't use a lot of the AAA size, but I needed a couple -- and I wanted spares. They're top quality, and a better price than local stores (including house brands).",5.0
8319,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),you certainly get what you pay for....I bought these because the cost was about half of what I pay for name brand batteries. They last about 25 as long as the brand batteries. Hmmmm...paid half for something that lasts one quarter......My financial advisor is still wagging his finger at me,1.0
8320,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),You get a lot for a great price! I mainly just use them for my xbox one controller and they last for quite a long time!,4.0

8322,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),Great batteries for an excellent price! Why pay more Free shipping with Prime. It doesn't get any better.,5.0
8323,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"At first we were completely happy with the Amazon Basics line of batteries. Reasonably priced and what we thought was good quality. Well, after a couple months of use in one of our daughters toys, two out of the three batteries that were in the device burst. This is nothing I have experienced with Duracell or Energizer. Will be switching back to Duracell Procell.",3.0
8324,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"These are okay. They aren't as long-lasting as name brands so in the end, I'm probably not saving money using these. That said, I like how they are packaged so they take up little space and we only have to open a 4 pack each time while still having plenty on hand. This beats the big packages of the name brands where the left over batteries end up falling out of the package and scatter in the drawer.",3.0
8325,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),These batteries are good for the remote or other things that arent using constant power. Ive burned through a lot of these quickly with electronics that require energy for extended use. The jurys still out on whether its better to buy a smaller pack of higher quality batteries or this pack theyre both basically the same price.,3.0
8326,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),Not the best.,3.0
8327,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"You can't beat the price, but I've had some of these batteries just die on me after less than a month of use.",3.0
8328,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"Sorry Amazon. You guys are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no hassle returns and I am a very happy customer. But I purchased a box each of your AAA, AA, and D Cell batteries. I have used the AAA's for remotes with no apparent problems so far. I have not used the D Cells yet, but the AA batteries are the worst batteries I have ever used. They don't last long in my flash lights. My son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit. I heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so. I wanted to know what happened, and looked inside the unit and the green - negative containment ring/sealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit. I had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because I am worried about my little ones getting acid on them. Amazon Your good name should not be on those bad batteries.",1.0
8329,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"The price and packaging on these batteries is wonderful, but the use-life is not. A pair of these, fresh out of the box, did not last 30 days in my Bluetooth mouse. I have gotten better results with rechargeables, and that is saying something.",3.0
8330,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"Good batteries just tested them, but there were only 98 batteries. I want my two batteries-- grr",4.0
8331,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"I am just speechless with these batteries. They are probably the best deal for good quality batteries you will ever find. I feel like they should cost more because they are really good and last a long time. In a way, I feel like they can compete with Duracell batteries.",5.0
8332,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),They worked just great!!,5.0
8333,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),Great value and great product,5.0
8334,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),Every bit as good as top brand name batteries. Why pay 2-3 times more This is a super deal.,5.0
8335,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),Very happy with these!!,5.0
8336,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Every time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment.",3.0
8337,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),they work. I don't know the life span or how well they work.,4.0

8341,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),and they work.,5.0
8342,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),Everyone read the 1 star reviews..the 5 star reviews must be people reviewing immediately. The 10 year promise is crap. I have 48 AA and 36 AAA batteries that are all dead after 1 year. The Dollar Tree batteries are better. Pay the extra money and don't fall for Amazons broken promises or guarantees.,1.0
