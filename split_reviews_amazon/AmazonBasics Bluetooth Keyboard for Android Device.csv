25878,AmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard for Android Devices - Black,"Like a lot of reviewers here, I struggled to find the right Bluetooth keyboard to go with my Kindle Fire HD. In the end, I decided to go with the Amazon one, figuring that because Amazon made the Fire and the keyboard, there would be fewer potential problems. At first, this was a good theory. I opened the keyboard as soon as it arrived and paired it immediately to my Kindle Fire HD. There were no problems and it worked perfectly.At first.Unfortunately for me, the next time I worked with the keyboard, I was on a plane trip. I decided to get some writing done (I write novels in my free time) and fired up the keyboard and the Fire. But this time, the keyboard wouldn't pair. At all. The Fire SAID the Keyboard could be paired -- it remembered they had been paired before -- but it just wouldn't pair it. I tried everything I could think of, including pressing the connect button on the keyboard several times to re-pair it. In the end, I had to give up. Instead, desperate to use the flight to write, I borrowed my wife's iPhone 4S. Oddly enough, that had NO problem connecting to the keyboard and I was writing in no time (albeit on a smaller screen and in the notes mode).When I arrived on vacation, I was worried I had a lemon on my hands. Sure, the keyboard worked, but not with the Fire, only the iPhone. That wasn't the plan. I noticed that other reviews said that the keyboard worked initially with the Fire and then wouldn't work again. I thought there was a major glitch.I decided to keep messing with it and discovered this problem and solution. If you ONLY pair the keyboard with the Fire, you will have no problems",4.0
25879,AmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard for Android Devices - Black,"Using this with my Samsung Galaxy Note. Overall works fine, even though I'm on Gingerbread and not 3.0. Slim and lightweight. Pairs instantly. Some specialty keys don't work, but I'm not concerned as its purpose is just to get in text. This keyboard is much faster than the on-screen keyboard for inputting text.However, Amazon does not sell a case for this keyboard. This is a perfect travel keyboard, but carrying it bare in my day bag concerned me. I did a LOT of searching for some kind of generic slip case that would fit. Nothing.Then I stumbled on the Domke protective wrap, which is just a square of padded material with Velcro at the corners. It's designed for wrapping cameras and lenses. The 11 square fit the keyboard perfectly. I took it down to a local tailor shop and for 3 they sewed up the long side of the square when folded over on itself and one of the short sides creating a slip case. The protective wrap has a soft felt-like side and a nylon side. I folded it with the soft side on the inside. Now I have a perfect slip case for the keyboard, and for just about 15 (12 for the wrap from Amazon and 3 for the sewing).",4.0
25880,AmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard for Android Devices - Black,"It's a bit smaller than Apple's wireless keyboard but still easy to type on. Comes with 2 AAA batteries. Has a physical on/off switch and also a button to push for paring. Would be great if it came in white color. Works great on my iPhone and PC.****Update Dec. 8****Since many people are asking: It works with any bluetooth enabled device that supports HID (which 99 of the devices out there supports already). I have tested it with iPad 2, iPhone 4S, Windows 7 laptop, Macbook Pro, Blackberry Playbook and Asus Transformer.",5.0
25881,AmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard for Android Devices - Black,"I'm typing this review on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 using this BT keyboard. I never would have attempted to type a review without a keyboard like this.I've had great luck with it. It paired up quickly and hasn't given me any trouble. The Kindle recognized it and gave me a 4 digit code to enter. I typed the code on the keyboard and it paired right up.I've been using this on the commuter train when I travel and it's really fantastic. I read the other reviews and see where others had trouble. I assume these kinks have been worked out in the Kindle software, because it's working great for me.A couple of nice things about the way it works with the Kindle Fire HD:* Once the BT keyboard is paired, the soft keyboard no longer displays on the screen when you're in a text field. This leaves you with a lot more viewable space on the screen.* You can navigate through the screen with the arrow keys and press enter to activate a button. Tapping on the screen is still faster, but it's nice to have the option to navigate either way.* The Home and Menu buttons work great on the Fire. From any screen, press the Home button on the keyboard and it takes you to the Fire's home page.",4.0

25883,AmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard for Android Devices - Black,"I waited to get this keyboard until I did a little bit of research, and I think that made all the difference. In the time it took me to do the research, Amazon had pushed out an update that fixed the Bluetooth problem the keyboard had been having. A lot of the one-star reviews are from people who bought the keyboard when this problem hadn't been solved yet.The keyboard itself has all the keys you'd expect: alphanumeric keys, up, down, left and right keys, and a few extra, like keys for the volume and a Home key that actually takes you to the carousel screen. However, there are a few curious omissions:1) No Page Up or Page Down2) No Delete key. (There's a Backspace key, but that's not the same thing.)The keys are well-spaced and it's not a problem touch typing on the keyboard. It's certainly not as spacious as a full-sized keyboard, but it's about the size of a keyboard on a smallish laptop.The one thing they could add that might make this keyboard close to perfect is a way to carry it. It's a perfect portable size, but it's not something I would want to store in a backpack. I will probably keep the box it came in for travel purposes.",4.0
