12852,AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters),"This is a good length cable for those that don't want tight connections because a cable is too short. I alternate back and forth between using two printers so having a longer cable allows me to keep two printers near the computer.Setup worked flawlessly, it hooked up easily and the computer recognized the usb connection. I was set to print and have been enjoying this cable ever since.Final thoughts, the best length of the cable really depends on your setup situation but a longer one like this gives you more flexibility of where you want your attached device.",5.0
12853,AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters),"I found this wire to be of good quality. It performed as well as any other USB 3.0 cable and, to the extent that you would prefer something 'in black', this is the one to go. Amazon sells them in several lengths so you just get the right size.Of course, this is a generic USB 3.0 cable but it's nice that the connectors are or appear to be gold-plated. And, of course, it's an AmazonBasics which means that price is very much 'right' and you can always rely on Amazon's quick and efficient customer service and support.",5.0
12854,AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters),"I am using the 3' version of this cable and it works great. It work well with my external Seagate 3.0 drive. I just connected it and it worked flawlessly. The cable is sturdy and is gold plated for better connectivity (I assume that helps. There is no real way to test that at home).The cables are priced similarly to competitors. The nice thing about it being an Amazon product is that I am sure the return policy would be simple and quick. One word of caution is make sure both devices you are connecting are USB 3.0. The A side will fit in a 2.0 socket, but the B side will not. Check your devices documentation. It does no good to use this cable if both devices are not USB 3.0. You will create a bottleneck at the 2.0 side.Otherwise, this is a great little cable and you can't go wrong with it.",5.0
12855,AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters),"The cable works without any issues. The connectors at both end are gold plated, and the cable is 9 feet long. The cable is shielded as in the picture, it's a plain cover. As in the picture, one side is the rectangle-shaped connector (which connects to your PC), and the other end is the new USB 3.0 stack connector (which connects to your device). Make sure your device has this connector. I have been using AmazonBasics cables for almost everything, HDMI, optical audio, USB, and they are all reliable. No issues with any of the twenty AmazonBasics cables I own.",5.0
12856,AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters),I have several AmazonBasics cables now and they've all been great. This particular AmazonBasics USB 3.0 cable is 9 feet long and delivers full bandwidth between my Mac and my external hard drive.Build quality is very good and the connectors are gold-plated to ensure data contact. AmazonBasics is well worth considering when shopping for cables.,5.0
12857,AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters),"I built my last home PC and used a motherboard with native USB 3.0 connectors. I've used this cable between a USB 3.0 hub and my computer's USB 3.0 ports. This cable features solid construction and good shielding. The connections work well, and the cable upholds USB 3.0 data throughput speeds to the flash drives and portable USB 3.0 hard drives I've plugged into the hub. In all, a solid value.",5.0
