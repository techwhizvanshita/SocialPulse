12086,AmazonBasics Ventilated Adjustable Laptop Stand,"With an Income Tax Preparation practice I'm on my laptop 10 hours a day entering data. Using the laptop keyboard and mouse pad on the flat and level angle that laptops offer is stressful. An elevated keyboard serves the purpose of 'tilting' the keyboard into a natural position for typing. This AmazonBasic Ventilated and Adjustable laptop stand is perfect and produces the effect of a typewriter slant for those who grew up on IBM Selectrics or Royals. Fully adjustable for just about any angle you are comfortable with. Well made, light weight and it looks as a 'piece of the laptop' in sight. One small warning: the tabs on the front end that keep your laptop from sliding off may be a bit short for some laptops. The tabs rise only .75 of an inch (3/4). My current, and several past laptops, the front sits 1.0 inches (1) at top front but slanting down at .75 of an inch (3/4) inward. The slant keeps the tabs on the stand from holding the laptop in place - causing the laptop to slip down and off. Simple solution to this: Binder Clips. Use the medium size binder clip, one on each of the stand tabs. You can find 'binder clips' on the Amazon web site. A box is under 4 but you only need 2 medium binder clips so . . . check with a school teacher or office worker and get two for free. Other than that, the right tool at the right price. Buy one and see for yourself. You'll be glad you did.",5.0
12087,AmazonBasics Ventilated Adjustable Laptop Stand,"Simple in its design, with multiple angles, the mesh keeps your laptop cool, the cord keeper in back keeps organized, and the surface area is great for a 15.6 laptop. I think this would also work for a 17 laptop, but there may be a larger model for those. Check first. The only gripe I have about this unit is the two 'tabs' that keep the laptop from sliding down into your lap when adjusted up at an angle. These two tabs could benefit from being 1/2 taller than they are. This would allow a 'thicker' laptop base from 'spillage' like my Toshiba seems to occasionally do. So that is my only con for this item. I would still suggest buying it.",4.0
12088,AmazonBasics Ventilated Adjustable Laptop Stand,"Can't seem to say enough about this awesome stand. This allows me to utilize my laptop monitor and a second flawlessly. The cord keep on the back is great as well. I am about to purchase another monitor and with the choices of adjustment angle, this stand should place the two screens side by side perfectly for that one as well.There is no vibration through the metal as the contacts on the bottom are padded. The fan on my laptop almost never comes on even during day long uploads to the cloud due to this stand having it suspended in air on mesh.Very, very glad I made this purchase. Easily worth much more than I paid, the options for adjustment angles are ample, and lets my expensive baby run cool. Buy with confidence!",5.0

12091,AmazonBasics Ventilated Adjustable Laptop Stand,The two guard stops at the bottom are WAY TOO HIGH. They dig into my wrists are are painful after only 5 minutes.Everything else about the stand is excellent for a 13 laptop. It'll only work if you use an extended keyboard.Impossible to type directly on the laptop b/c of poor design. The guards just need to be brought down and 1/2 their size and this would be perfect.,2.0
12092,AmazonBasics Ventilated Adjustable Laptop Stand,"I mostly use my laptop on my lap. Go figure. I have a 17 inch laptop and have tired a few other portable laptop holders, all plastic, and they have all broken with in a couple of months. This one is metal but still lightweight. It also has the added value of having a flat, perforated base which makes it more comfortable in my lap and it gives me a place to place peripherals such as external hard drives. I am very happy with this product and recommend it.",5.0
12093,AmazonBasics Ventilated Adjustable Laptop Stand,"Every other laptop cooler I have purchased has a USB plug to run a fan. Got tired of the fans making noise, the USB or cooler plug not working eventually etc.So gave this one a shot and it does what it says plus. Keeps my 15.6 Mac book pro cool and my legs are not heating up any more when sitting on the couch. Also the bottom does not feel nearly as hot as it used to. So why only 4 stars. The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. Really uncomfortable. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I now rest the laptop on the pads so when typing my arms are resting on the key board portion as if the tabs were not there. Much more comfortable. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Certainly not a technical fix but does the job. All they had to do was include a metal piece retrofit on the bottom portion that would allow you to raise your computer to a level so the tabs would not interfere. Simple but maybe on the next model. Check out the two photos.",4.0

12096,AmazonBasics Ventilated Adjustable Laptop Stand,"This is simple, well made and appears to be durable. The size means that I can sit in my favorite chair with my laptop. Other units that I have used were either larger than I wanted, or overly complicated and subject to breakage.",4.0
12097,AmazonBasics Ventilated Adjustable Laptop Stand,"If you're looking for something to keep your laptop cool, this will do the trick. Although only bad things are, it isn't comfortable sitting on your lap as the metal just isn't awesome. The rivets where you rest your hands are welded things and they're uncomfortable as they dig into your hands when trying to type or even resting your hands. Wouldn't recommend..",3.0
