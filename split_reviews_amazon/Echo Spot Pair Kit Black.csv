8350,Echo Spot Pair Kit (Black),"ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THE SCREEN IS SMALL, IT'S A GREAT LITTLE DEVICE. FOR THOSE THAT PREFER A LARGER SCREEN, THE ECHO SHOW WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE.",4.0
8351,Echo Spot Pair Kit (Black),"I wasn't sure I even wanted this item, but caught up in all the excitement surrounding the Alexa enabled devices. Well....after getting it home I became addicted and ordered two Echos for the entertainment stand and today I have to Sub coming. I can't say enough for the product as well as the quick service/pick up at the Target store. Great service and product!",5.0
