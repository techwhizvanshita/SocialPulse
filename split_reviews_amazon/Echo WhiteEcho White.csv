Echo (White),,,","Stay away from the certified refurbished Amazon Fire TV. I received two Certified Refurbished defective fire TVs. The first the screen looked half corrupted, see the pictures. The second Certified Refurbished Amazon fire tv I received would not boot up, it was stuck in an infinite loop where I would only see the amazon logo for 10 seconds then it would boot up again.If anything, Amazon needs to re-visit its refurbishment process and quality control of the refurbished products they let get in consumer hands.Update 11/28/16: I purchased a new Fire TV during the BF sale and I have had no issues so far :).",1.0

Echo (White),,,","I seriously wonder why it took me to get FireTV for so long. I originally had a Roku XS and then I stupidly bought a Roku 4. Both devices were all right but neither could handle 5.1 audio from Netflix on my Vizio sound bar (essentially your device must be cable of handling Dolby Digital Plus and nothing less using Roku). I finally decided to give FireTV a try and I'm amazed. Not only does it convert DD+ to DD on Netflix and HBO Go, I can install XBMC (Kodi) on it! I wish I knew about this before I bought my Roku 4 and HTPC. I now literally have no use for my HTPC anymore... FireTV can handle EVERYTHING now and all with DD and DTS 5.1 audio. Even better, I have a ton of smart devices and 3 Echos... I can now control all of these devices directly from the remote. This is seriously one of the best purchases I have made in the past year.",5.0

Echo (White),,,","I bought this thinking since we'd bought several other refurbished things that worked, that it would be okay.

Echo (White),,,","Certified garbage! Lesson learned about paying attention to reviews. Fire TV box and remote was packaged like new, even included new batteries. After plugging it in it would only show Amazon logo and 'unknown boot' on screen. Cycled power several times and even tried to reset using remote buttons, no dice. I read all the negative reviews before I purchased this, I chose to take the chance so I'm angry with myself, but very disappointed with Amazon for even suggesting this is refurbished, let alone certified, as if that means something.",1.0

Echo (White),,,","I bought this after being an avid Apple fan for the last 10 years. I had old style two Apple TV's and even bought a new Apple TV to help with me cutting the cord to DirectTV after 11 years. I switch to using the Apple TV with the DirecTV Now streaming service. After the Apple TV would no longer let friends or family airplay to it because of new updates or let me load any third party apps I knew it was time to switch. It was a great switch to the Fire TV and I have not looked back. I have been able to load numerous apps that are not available on the Apple TV such as Showbox and Kodi. My biggest complaint was the Fire TV remote was not able to control the volume on my sound bar like the Apple TV remote and was not able to turn my TV or sound bar on or off. The Sideclick remote was exactly what I needed. I was able to program the remote to control power and sound level, along with change the input on the TV. I would highly recommend using the Fire TV.Pros:Works extremely wellAllows 3rd party app installationMuch cheaper than Apple TVAllows use of amazon music which Apple TV did notCons:Home page is not at visually pleasing as the Apple TVRemote does not have volume controlsRemote is not touch sensitive and has a very loud *click* noise when pushing buttons.",5.0
21569,"Echo (White),,,
Echo (White),,,",I bought this thing refurbished. I find that I have to unplug / plug back in the HDMI cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the TV. Not sure if it is the Amazon Fire box itself or if it is the TV (Not likely).Otherwise it is a good device. I bought it for the ability to hard wire my Ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for 4K capabilities which it does do. Having the Alexa app is handy but her features can be severely handicapped.I probably should have just bought it new..... usually refurbished devices work well as they are tested before resale and it was probably tough to catch that the HDMI port on these might be finicky. I may have to switch it out.,2.0

21627,"Echo (White),,,
Echo (White),,,","I will start with the disclaimer, I am not an Amazon Prime member. I have a feeling this tablet really roars around within the AP environment. Instead, I purchased it to watch YouTube videos, Netflix and Hulu shows, read a few digital books, and maybe other stuff down the road. Yes, there is an app for Hulu and Netflix and YouTube. But the Netflix app stopped seeing my memory card and a reinstall didn't fix it. This means I can't download videos to the 64 GB card I bought.I figured, I should be able to move files back and forth - but that doesn't work. No way to move the content to the card. So I have 64 GB unusable for Netflix and am stuck loading on the 8GB internal memory. When I take this thing on the road, I will have to rely on wifi to replenish titles along the way.The picture is good, though, bright enough and clear. Sound is just ok and I am disappointed by the top volume through both the speaker and the headphone jack - it barely cuts above the fans from my AC. I plan on adding a Bluetooth speaker at some point, but am guessing I will run into a similar issue - how to get more volume.At $50, I am plenty happy with the device, but it should use Android aps better. I know Amazon wants me on prime, but I should still get the best experience possible.",4.0

Echo (White),,,","I really enjoy the Echo. I got an Echo Dot and liked it so much I then got the full size Echo. I originally go the Echo Dot for the novelty thinking I wouldn't really use it very much but it turns out that I use them all the time. It is not something that anyone really needs but it is handy and a lot of fun. Some of the things it does really well: It's great at voice recognition - you seldom have to repeat yourself. Setting timers, reminders, and alarms is as easy as saying Alexa, wake me at 7 am Or Alexa, tell me when 10 minutes is up. If you are a Prime member the Echo is great at playing music from your music library or from Prime music. It's also great at playing radio stations (using tune-in and other apps). In the morning I'll say Alexa, play 680 WRKO to listen to Kim and VB on the radio. Some of the things the Echo is bad at: It's well known that it uses Microsoft's Bing search engine so most anything the Echo has to search for comes back with the response I don't know that. Being able to tell the Echo to use Yahoo or Google would make this a five star rating. Also, if you set an alarm or reminder it only reminds you on the device you specify or the one that hears you. For example, if I'm in the upstairs bedroom (location of the Echo Dot) and say Remind me to call John Smith in 10 minutes and then I go downstairs to the kitchen (location of the Echo), the reminder will only be in the bedroom. It would be nice if I could have an alarm or reminder set on both devices. The Echo Dot has the same capability as the full size Echo as far as I can tell. The only difference is the full size Echo has much better sound for music. That being said, the Echo Dot still sounds great, amazing really, for such a small device. But the full size Echo is like listening to a stereo. Again, these are well-made devices and are a lot of fun and very useful. Maybe not a necessity but they sure are a fun conversation piece with guests or grandkids come around.",4.0

If you don't have these items or Prime, I would get the Google Home. You can listen to music and books using the different Google apps. With the echo you can order from Prime.

Echo (White),,,","Found out after having had opened and tried programming this awesome alexa that basically nothing comes with it. It's a listening device in my home that won't do anything unless I pay more into Amazon. The fact that I synced my pandora account is pointless because I have to spell out what I want Alexa to play by saying, ""Alexa play 'X' station from my pandora play list."" How is the rest of my family suppose to know what to request when I am the only one who knows my pandora play list (and barely at that!)

Echo (White),,,","I waited a while before going with Amazon to start automating my home. I had considered Google Home, but since I wanted to have multiple rooms linked, it was much cheaper to go the Echo route since the Dot was only $40/each on sale. It has more after-market apps and seems to be integrated into more home automation systems (lights, TVs, alarm systems, etc.) than Google Home. It is also much sleeker and attractive to have sitting in your living room than Google. It is a bit of a novelty at the moment but is quickly becoming an integral part of our house.I was a little disappointed in the pricing ($140 on sale) since the Echo Dot, as I mentioned, was only $40 and does everything the Echo does, minus a better speaker. The Dot does have a 3.5mm output jack, so you can hook it up to a sound system or Bluetooth speaker. So, if you do not use your Echo to listen to music, it was a little overkill for the price.",4.0

Echo (White),,,","Before the Echo we played music often for our toddler via Pandora on the Amazon Firestick. I am generally not an early adopter for the newest technology, but with a 95% music use case in mind and to experiment I pulled the trigger and bought one. Within a week I subscribed to the single-device option for Amazon Music Unlimited at a cost of 3.99/month after a free 30-day trial. Now we rarely use Pandora due to the expansive Amazon selection. I also upgraded to a smart thermostat and am looking into Philips Hue Color lighting. My experience has been positive enough to also buy an Echo Dot with Harman-Kardon Onyx Mini speaker for my parents. While great, however, there are opportunities for improvement:1. Sometimes Alexa fails to find a selection which it succeeded at before. I made sure my command was identical and clear.2. The suite of skills is weak and mostly pointless. I only use the news flash, weather, and traffic.3. Search functionality for facts/answers is limited and based on reviews is likely worse than Google Home.4. There is no integration with the Firestick/ Fire TV which is surprising. Currently one must buy a Logitech Harmony hub to do so.5. Alexa struggles to find certain classical pieces even though I have confirmed them to be available on Amazon Music.

Examples are questions or requests such as ""how many calories are in a pop-tart"", searching for certain songs or types of music, and calculating time and distance between two cities by car. The Home was able to do all of these things while the Echo was not. The home also tends to provide information beyond the direct answer to your question while the Echo does not.

Echo (White),,,","I have recently purchased a home, and I have been set on a mission to make my home as connected as possible. Finding the right product lineup has been interesting.However, the Alexa product was a no brainer. In our house we are Amazon Prime members, so we can take advantage of the music and 2-day shipping orders from Alexa. These are after thoughts, as I bought Alexa to control my smart home setup with my voice.Many believe you can just buy Alexa and control your home. This is not the case. You can use Alexa as a smart home hub with WeMo products, but this uses Wifi and the devices easily connect and disconnect throughout the day if not setup properly.In my setup, I have a Wink hub connected to z-wave products around the home. Wink can also connect to online services like Google's Nest Services and Chamberlin MyQ garage, but unfortunately they are not able to be directly controlled by Alexa for the Wink Hub.With that being said, for Z-Wave and Zigbee products, I can tell Alexa to turn on and off these products. As well as, if setup with a dimmer, what percentage to set them at. Often times this is quicker than the Wink app itself.Pros:Wink Compatible.Logitech Harmony Hub Compatible.Nest Compatible.IFTTT Compatible.Can read Audible Audio Books.Sound from speaker can fill a fair sized family room.Makes home automation more intelligent.Cons:Sometimes doesn't respond appropriately.Price is a bit high.To summarize, the Alexa functionality of this product is limited.

Echo (White),,,","I bought this to fill my life with music. The first two weeks were fantastic. I got Amazon Music, and needed only to say, ""Alexa, play (insert artist name, song name, or album name)"" and it would play music. The speaker quality is great. 4 days after Christmas it went into a Christmas Music and hymn default. Whatever artist I requested, it would play the first song, and then default to religious music. I'd switch artists and it'd happen again. I contacted Amazon, and was told not to request artists. I needed to specify albums and songs. I don't have this info memorized. I bought it to say artist names. Someone responding to my poor review on Amazon suggested trying different music services. I dumped Amazon music and started requesting music on Pandora. Alexa misunderstood my granddaughters request, and played Christmas music on Pandora, although we were now well into Jan. I'm no longer having the Christmas music problem, but Alexa is just ok playing music from Pandora. Sometimes it gets it right, sometimes not. I am so disappointed in it, that I plug it in when I want to hear music, and unplug it, and ignore it most of the time. When it worked the first two weeks, I raved about it.

All you can do is say volume up, volume down or say volume lever 1-10.At no time was I told that you needed to use your smart phone and or table to down load the Alexa App and then run everything through that. Most of the time I say Alexa who is Morris Knight. ""I don't know"" Alexa was Morris Knight a VJ on MTV. ""I don't know"". Alexa can you tell me who was a VJ on MTV ""I don't know"". So I get ""I don't know"" more often then an get and answer. If I do get an answer Alexa will often give me an answer to a for a different person the person I asked about.If you have a Amazon Fire Stick. Don't ask Alexa about a ""MOVIE"" or is Joan Collins in the movie The Virgin Queen. Because for me anytime I use the word ""MOVIE"" she will turn on my Fire Stick.

And I am not exaggerating when I say that she often interacts with Alexa/Echo over 100 times throughout the day!So far, she uses Alexa/Echo to listen to her favorite music through my Prime Music subscription. We recently purchased a few songs that she couldn't find in Prime Music. She also often asks it to tell her a joke and check the weather outside. She says the staff at the nursing facility where she lives seem to be amazed by the device as well and she often demonstrates its capabilities asking it to tell her who the current president is. Currently, I am helping her become familiar with its ability to play local radios stations, especially the ones that broadcast Kentucky Wildcat sports games. When I reminded her that it could read books aloud, she requested a chapter of the Bible; I found a beautiful professionally produced audio version with professional voice actors on Audible.This product has been a real revolution in my aunt's day-to-day life and the Prime Music connectivity is bringing her great pleasure and stimulation. I am giving it five stars because she is able to use it unassisted simply with her voice and because the Alexa app gives me a new fascinating way to keep track of one aspect of her day. My aunt hopes that a future update will allow it to control her TV and make/receive phone calls.",5.0

With 6 DOT, 1 Echo and smart 42 devices connected, the home is very smart. Echo and DOTs make it happen. I still use Echo in one location since it was the first part of the system I bought.

Echo (White),,,","When I made this purchase, it was for what I thought was a nice little gadget that would allow me to listen to Amazon Unlimited Music. I plugged it in and the setup was a breeze. I was able to get the Amazon Unlimited Music at a great price (only $3.99/mo if used only on an Echo product), and the quality amazed me.Then, I was in another room and decided to see how far this could pick up my voice commands...and spoke, loudly, a command to play music from one of my playlists, and the Amazon Echo actually heard me correctly...from three rooms away!So I started checking this item out a bit more. It now turns on my TV (I already had a Harmony hub), can use it to change channels, turn on Roku, etc. With just a few other smart home gadgets, this Amazon Echo can turn lights off and on all by voice commands. It can control a thermostat, turn on a coffee pot. The possibilities seem endless. When I purchased this Echo I had no idea it did so much. You know what else it can do? It can order items through Amazon by voice, add reminders to my calendar, make a shopping list for later use and even help me tune my guitar! If you have a large home, you can pick up an Amazon Dot, which allows you to access your smart home devices when the Amazon Echo is at the other end of the house. Forget to turn off the living room TV and you're already snug in your bed? Amazon Echo can remedy that with a single command if you use the Harmony hub. Want to set an early morning alarm? Just ask the Amazon Echo to do so and let it wake you to the sound of your choice. Having trouble falling asleep? Ask Amazon Echo or Dot to read one of your Kindle E-books or play some relaxing music. All in all an EXCELLENT product that not only makes life easier, but fun!",5.0

So far, I can turn on/off & dim my lights in my living room with just my voice. Love it...!!! Once I get more bulbs for my bedroom and hallway, I'll add those too. It just gets expensive at $29.99 - $49.99 per bulb!!!Also, I wish you could re-name/call it something other than Alexa, Amazon or Echo.
