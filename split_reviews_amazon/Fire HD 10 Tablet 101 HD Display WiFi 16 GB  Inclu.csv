There are several offline options to load files onto the SD card, or to your tablets memory, so you can watch movies or use it as a mp3 player while away from internet. I watched a 2 hour movie on the airplane and only went through 30% of the battery power. Beautiful screen, loud speakers with the option for headphones.

I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading.

Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.",1.0
