While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect!

While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect!
