When he opened it he was amazed at the size and weight of this one. He also was very elated that all his books that he purchased immediately downloaded to the new one with his bookmarks in place.

With how far technology has grown on phones she was only looking for a reader and something that was lighter on her thumbs when reading then her kindle fire.

I previously had a Kindle Fire, which was fine, but this is definitely nicer for reading. But it all depends on what you need it for, and how often you will use it.",4.0

21002,"Kindle Paperwhite E-reader - White, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi) with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers,,","My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working.",1.0

21005,"Kindle Paperwhite E-reader - White, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi) with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers,,","the screen flush with the sides is great. The glass feeling is really nice. I don't use the side buttons for page turning but only because of habit. They are great and the need for pressure allows me to hold the kindle without changing pages. But, the price is painful. It is a splurge purchase since the paperwhite is just about as good in nearly every respect.",4.0

21011,"Kindle Paperwhite E-reader - White, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi) with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers,,","I exchanged the paper white that I had bought for this Voyage. This is thinner, lighter and just easier to hold than the paperwhite. Still getting used to the archive system since I had a Nook before, bit of a learning curve. But I like the Kindle interface better than the Nook, the book suggestions and shopping for books is much better. The only thing I miss is that the Kindle doesn't tell you what % battery you have left, it just shows you the bar in the battery symbol.",4.0
21012,"Kindle Paperwhite E-reader - White, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi) with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers,,","I think this is a great ereader, I think even better than the Oasis that just came out. I do like that one but I love that this one seems sturdier and offers the automatic brightness adjustment and the vibration feedback when turning pages. One thing I didnt like was that it was hard to find where the page turn areas were at while reading in the dark. To remedy this, I bought a few aluminum button stickers and put them on the lines of the device",4.0

21014,"Kindle Paperwhite E-reader - White, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi) with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers,,",I will start off with the fact that I like paper books a lot. I bought the e reader because it's light and can travel with multiple books. The interface is fairly easy to use and it holds a lot of books. The automatic light feature doesn't work as nicely as I would. Overall I am happy with the purchase but there are features that could make it a 5.,4.0
