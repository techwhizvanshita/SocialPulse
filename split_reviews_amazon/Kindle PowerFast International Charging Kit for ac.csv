12206,Kindle PowerFast International Charging Kit (for accelerated charging in over 200 countries),"I travel internationally at least once a year and wanted an EASY way to charge my Kindle Fire HD. The design of this system is great. It's one basic plug and cord with changeable heads. It's easy to use and easy to pack. I tried out the European head recently in Norway and it worded great. Some voltage converter + plug adapter sets don't work well there because the Norwegian outlets are deep. This worked perfectly. I also bought this set because it had a U.S. plug and I can charge quickly here at home. There have been some criticisms that the country name isn't printed on the plug head, but the set comes with an extensive list of which heads are needed for which countries, which I find to be adequate. A great product.",5.0
12207,Kindle PowerFast International Charging Kit (for accelerated charging in over 200 countries),"Works on my kindle, Samsung Galaxy Note and my IPod Touch!!! Love this multi-funtional charger! I didn't need the international kit but i wasn't sure...maybe on day it will come in handy.",5.0
12208,Kindle PowerFast International Charging Kit (for accelerated charging in over 200 countries),"I recently went out of the country and took this charging kit with me. Changing the different plugs adapters was extremely easy, and I had no problems with the setup and charging my Kindle. In fact the charger that is included in this kit is a slightly larger wattage than the adapter that came with my Fire HDX, which allowed for faster charging. Since returning home, I have attached the US 110W adapter and am using it as an additional adapter. The one issue that would have made this item better would have been if they had included a carrying bag for the adapters. Yes, I'd love a nice carrying case, but even if that wasn't an option, having a cloth bag with a draw string would have been preferable since some people may need multiple adapters when the travel.",5.0
12209,Kindle PowerFast International Charging Kit (for accelerated charging in over 200 countries),"As abv, takes 3 + hours to fully charge. I hoped it would be much faster (maybe an hour), to the point that I had thought I got a lemon. People were kind enough to answer my question, and learned that I should not expect miracles, lol. Apart from that, good thing it comes with the cord, and is compact enough.",4.0
12210,Kindle PowerFast International Charging Kit (for accelerated charging in over 200 countries),"I do a lot of international travelling, so I have bought just about every conversion and adapter kit on the market. This is the best-made and most versatile I have seen to charge electronic devices, including but not limited to the Kindles. It is a powerful 9 watts and will work safely on any device using a micro-B USB charging port. It can also be used with non-standard devices, like Apple products or older electronics having mini-B ports, as long as you have the appropriate USB cord for it. It can be used in almost every country (the standard European C plug can be used in most outliers like the South American countries and Israel because their plugs are dual type).The charger is as small as it could be for such a powerful charger, is very durable, and compact. I like it because the interchangeable plugs actually form part of the charger. I have a bad tendency to leave adapters in the wall socket and just remove my US charger. The next hotel guest gets a free adapter.This is at a new price of 29.99(10 less than before). This makes it a very good value, considering the design and quality. Unlike the standard PowerFast charger for the Kindle Fire, this kit comes with a USB cord, so it is complete. An added bonus is that the adapters can twist on in any direction, so you can position the USB cord on the side, top or bottom.",5.0
