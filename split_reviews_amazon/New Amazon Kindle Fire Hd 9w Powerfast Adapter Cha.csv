New Amazon Kindle Fire Hd 9w Powerfast Adapter Charger + Micro Usb Angle Cable,,,","So I was excited to get this when Best Buy started caring them. The thrill for was short lived. First week was fun to use it for music, weather, cooking, and jokes. But after that I lost interest. Attaching to my Hue lights and Nest were a longer process to make it work. I'd rather pull my phone out. Plus with a 2 story house it is useless if not on the same floor. Maybe I'll buy it again or a 2nd version when its released",3.0

New Amazon Kindle Fire Hd 9w Powerfast Adapter Charger + Micro Usb Angle Cable,,,","This is my new favorite device. While not perfect, it's a lot of un to use.One of the features I like the best is the timer functions. I can start a timer for various items, while cooking, and Alexa will remind me when the timer hits zero. The best part is that, through IFTT, I can trigger Alexa to call my phone, or send a notification, if I'm not in the same room as she is. I do the same for when I'm doing laundry. I no longer have to go back and check how much time is left on the washer and dryer. I can even have my Hue lights to blink when the timer has expired.Right now, I have Lutron, iDevices, and Hue Homekit devices in my house. Through the Skills for each of these companies, the Echo found all the devices, and I'm not able to control all of them using my voice. Really great device to own and play around with.",5.0

New Amazon Kindle Fire Hd 9w Powerfast Adapter Charger + Micro Usb Angle Cable,,,","I got this to basically experiment with. Straight out of the box, it's really not that impressive. It's a ""novelty"", however, as I checked out the skills available, lights started coming on - Literally! Echo's ability to integrate with Home Automation is excellent! Having voice commands for turning on/off lights may seem like a novelty as well, however, there are endless options for the elderly, or disabled with this little assistant, and some customizing.",5.0

New Amazon Kindle Fire Hd 9w Powerfast Adapter Charger + Micro Usb Angle Cable,,,","Good product that does the basics. Too bad you have to buy a specific light control or security system to make this useful. My Smart TV's are connected to the internet, so why not control them too? But I was impressed when I asked ""Alexa, whats on TV for the Olympics tonight?"" and the response was Swimming at xx time, Gymnastics at yy time. Far more info than the TV guide on screen showing only a 4 hour block on NBC. It is the beginning of things to come.",4.0
