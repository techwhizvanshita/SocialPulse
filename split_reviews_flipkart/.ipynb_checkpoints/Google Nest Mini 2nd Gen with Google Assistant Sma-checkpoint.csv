60957,Google Nest Mini (2nd Gen) with Google Assistant Smart Speaker?ÿ?ÿ(Chalk),"Simply awesome!! This device is very useful than I thought it would be. Plays music very well at a moderate bass. Voice detection is too good. Making a duo audio call, broadcasting messages at its base location, playing music through YOUTUBE premium/gaana, giving Voice commands for playing media on Netflix, controlling smart lights & TV are very useful features.

60971,Google Nest Mini (2nd Gen) with Google Assistant Smart Speaker?ÿ?ÿ(Chalk),I'm loving it. It's good to have an assistant by your side. Sound quality is not great but ok. Sound clarity at higher volumes is below average.But smart features are damn cool.,5

60974,Google Nest Mini (2nd Gen) with Google Assistant Smart Speaker?ÿ?ÿ(Chalk),I need not say a lot as everything is known here as we get the Google prowess.This is the best smart assistant period Alexa and Siri don't even come close.The setting up was also seamless and easy but was lengthy.The sound quality is very clear the vocals are crystal clear.instrument separation though not very good is sufficeable for the price.Does pick my voice command very very neatly Very sensitive mics.And this speaker does not have a battery so battery backup is not a thing you mu...,4
60975,Google Nest Mini (2nd Gen) with Google Assistant Smart Speaker?ÿ?ÿ(Chalk),"The Google Nest Mini is a device for extremely lazy music lovers. It works well if you have a YouTube premium account coz the collections in gaana is limited. The assistant do respond to sounds in the normal range but most times there is a  need for a higher level of sound to activate the Google assistant. If Google could have made support available for Indian regional languages, I would have recommended it as the best smart speaker in this price range.. also the speaker is not very loud but ...",4

62534,Google Nest Mini (2nd Gen) with Google Assistant Smart Speaker?ÿ?ÿ(Chalk),Got it for 1499 in BBD offer. Useful product overall considering the ease of use with smart appliances. Can't be used for alarms and reminders as if you miss it then it's done. Better to use smartphones for that purpose. Also it could have been better if it came with power backup or even a micro usb or usb c charging point. Now i have to carry a separate charger whenever i travel. (I know it's for home use but shifting cities can be a pain),3
