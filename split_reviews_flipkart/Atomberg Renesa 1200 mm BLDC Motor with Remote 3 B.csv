By the way, this fan is a dust magnet - my normal fans does not attract this much dust as this does :DAtomberg could have provided a remote holder too.

The Air flow is good . Looks sleek & Good. Remote is small and fine . One thing you must remember that you have to disable your regulator after installation and keep it on full . Then disconnect it. Once installed you have to use all functions only through remote. Price appears to be on the higher side but that is the trend with most remote control fans. Power consumption needs to be checked.,3
