181030,"BAJAJ 3 L Instant Water Geyser (Ivora/ flora, White)","At this price, it is very good Deal. Installation was done smoothly by Bajaj technician only at free of cost.So it is must buy product for small family.",4
181031,"BAJAJ 3 L Instant Water Geyser (Ivora/ flora, White)",3L instant geyser with hot water coming in just 2 mins.. Good for 1-2 persons..  Installation was done by Bajaj as a part of their offer and we also get an inlet and an outlet pipe of 1.5 m. To avail installation we need to call their toll-free no. after product delivery. But before that we need to make sure that plumbing and electrical works are complete. It costed me more or less the same value as the geyser price for the plumbing and electrical part. So be prepared for it.,4
181032,"BAJAJ 3 L Instant Water Geyser (Ivora/ flora, White)",Very good product. Within 3 to 4 minutes water will hot. Installation done by Bajaj Service free of cost and also with hose pipe after day of booking. Service engineer was polite and well behaved. I'm happy with this product. Must buy it if 2 or 3 members family.,5
181033,"BAJAJ 3 L Instant Water Geyser (Ivora/ flora, White)",Heating is very ð good and look wise ot is dashing and loking stylish ð ð and its shape was cute And it heated water ð§ in 2 minutes only Best for winters you get a easy and comfortable bath ð,5
181034,"BAJAJ 3 L Instant Water Geyser (Ivora/ flora, White)","It gives you only 3l water, it is not suitable for bathing, but it is useful for kitchen purposes... Cuz when you bath every time after 3 mins of hot water you have to wait for 5minutes together another 3l water to be heated up..... So I recommend this 3L geyser is only for kitchen purpose not for bateoom utilize... Instead of this use 5L or 10L bajaj geysers.... Other wise quality, everything is PERFECT WITH BAJAJ... ð",3
181035,"BAJAJ 3 L Instant Water Geyser (Ivora/ flora, White)","Compact Geyser.Works well. Didn't want to pay extra for installation so, self installed.Valves, Plug, and Tubes need to be bought separately. Only wall mount screws are provided in the box.Takes around 3-5mins for water to get heated and auto cuts off .Provides around 2L of hot water and half a litre of luke warm water. Suitable for kitchen use. For bathing, the heater need to heat for atleast 3 times for adequate water. Close tap..wait for heating, open tap.Ordered a V Guard Heater w...",4
181036,"BAJAJ 3 L Instant Water Geyser (Ivora/ flora, White)",Nice product work well I give review after 3 months of usage. And it is only for small family 4-6 people.,5
181037,"BAJAJ 3 L Instant Water Geyser (Ivora/ flora, White)",1) Received product as displayed on Flipkart. 2) Within 3 days product was installed by Bajaj authorised person free of cost. 3) Performance good so far. Installed one week before. 4) worth money5) only concern is that Plug is not provided. If I knew I would have purchased branded plug before installation . I had to buy whatever plug available with service man. Overall good Banana product.,5
181038,"BAJAJ 3 L Instant Water Geyser (Ivora/ flora, White)","Good Product Using it for 1 month now, Don't Expect a Proper Flow for Shower or even at Tap. But open the tap at lesser flow or at a rate of approx. 25Ltrs (Bucket size) /15mins (This rate can vary depending on the temperature and location) and you can get a continuous flow of hot water for bathing. If you are low on budget or in a Rented property this is a good product. I don't think family size matters.Just keep in mind this doesn't come with a Plug and Pipes.",5
181039,"BAJAJ 3 L Instant Water Geyser (Ivora/ flora, White)",Installation was smooth and free. Inlet and outlet Pipe was free that was good part of bajaj offer as no other brands give. Only missing thing was 3 pin. rest is good. Water get heated in matter of time. Thanks,5
