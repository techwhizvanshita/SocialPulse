816,"Crompton 75 L Desert Air Cooler?ÿ?ÿ(White, Teal, ACGC-DAC751)","it's really worth every single penny. it works like one ton AC provided that your room has proper ventilation.  I generally keep cooler near to window so that it can pull fresh air from outside and as a result I get very cool air. one more suggestion,  please don't buy cooler which are equipped with a blower fan. Always go for the cooler equipped with metal fan like this one.  In one word, this Compton cooler is Amazing. if you find the review helpful, please thumps up. Happy summer! ????",5

You can't sleep first 15 days with it due to bad smell. And after 15 days you have to compromise with it. Good for places which has no option for AC or fix desert cooler.So I have simply waisted money on it due to few chamcha  reviews. Anyhow...Have purchased and ...,4
