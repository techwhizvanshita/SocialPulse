I struggled with various settings and then gave up as it was just not happening.I switched on Chromecast and everything worked like a dream. it look me hardly a couple of minutes to set it up and it was ready to go, and this time I didnt even use a smart TV. All you need is an HDMI slot on the TV.The display is amazing and ...",5
175255,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"It works and its very easy to setup. Only problem is it says my phone is not optimized for screen mirroring and so doesn't work, but it could atleast attempt at doing so. Well, other than that the entire process was fairly straightforward. Nothing mindblowing here but yes, it transformed my dumb LED TV to a Smart LED TV. Earlier to listen to music I had to aux the soundbar to my phone and that required me to sit on the floor. Now I can sit on the couch and cast Spotify and chill. Using it fre...",4

175258,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"Good product. Bought on first day of launch on 24 October and received on 25th. Works on wifi router as well as mobile hotspot. First time installation is bit pain if using hotspot instead of router and takes few days to understand how to connect using hotspot as it will need two phones, one for hotspot and one to connect to chromecast. It will be better to watch tutorials on installing chromecast and Google Home app before buying this. Once connected, both phones can be used to cast and it w...",4
175259,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"This is best product for casting. If u have Unlimited data so I suggest buy this product.  If your TV not inbuilt WiFi.

175260,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"Is a decent purchase only for non Smart TVs. For Smart TVs, it's utter waste as most of the Indian streaming services don't support it and the ones that do, are already available in the TV software. For Smart TVs, would suggest Firestick owing to a separate remote that offers voice search across apps.",1

175262,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),The product is so good that I have no words. It has made my stupid lcd tv a smart tv. You can not cast  everything from apple products.

175272,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),It gives 6 months Gaana subscription and 1 year Sony liv subscription free. Easy setup. Good streaming. The only thing that bugs me is that I found it a bit slow (with fast internet connection). Streaming devices can be faster and they should be.Update: Chromecast is compatible with MX player. Good. So it can cast downloaded movies directly to your tv. Very good. But still I would like to give it just 1 star. Reason being Chromecast does not support major video formats. This is seriously un...,1

175291,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"This device sets up so easily that it suits the title ""Plug in N Play"". It needs an external power supply so adds a wire to it.

175295,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"Good Product for Google lovers. This device only for media streaming. The quality of video is medium. I connected to FHD screen but the video quality is 480p.

175297,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"I've been using this product since past 3 months and totally enjoying it.Its  the most hassle free device to cast and screen your phone. Almost all the apps are possible to be casted from your phone. and only a few apps, which are very specific or not popular, need to be mirrored to be watched on screen.I personally find it better than fire stick as many people think fire stick is better due to non dependency on phone.but let me tell you, nowadays you've everything on your phone only. an...",5

175299,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"Terrific. I know most people go for Amazon's Fire Stick but I much prefer this device. For starters, the NBA app isn't available on the Fire Stick (which is a deal breaker for me) and as far as I can tell neither is the Google Podcasts app. I also prefer searching for things on my phone and casting it to the screen to fiddling with another remote. The only disadvantage is no Prime Video (which I currently play off the app on my Ps4) but it's coming to the Chromecast soon. I have run into issu...",5

175301,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),Not much use full  . It will consume 4 GB data daily . So fast net connectivity  should be available . Then only it will work . Cost of this item is very high.,1
175302,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"It looks like Google has applied soffisticated softwares just to allow the viewers to watch its own YouTube and a few non- free channels it has tied up with. A number of Chromecastable free apps are available in Play Store, but none of them works. Even vlc player has  chrome cast support, but this product just gives an empty screen on TV.",2

I don't like below things:1. why there is need of 2 smartphones to connect although hotspot sharing and task performing both can be done only with one.2. why there is a need of internet always to connect. firstly I thought It would need only at first time to connect but it need same everytime.Otherwise, I got everything I want - smooth screen mirroring, casting, and yes, su...",4

175317,Google Chromecast 3 Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),Sometimes takes time to connect but once connected it is fast. With Google home casting whole mobile screen is faster than casting feature available within video apps. Works very well with mobile data. It would have been better if option to link with multiple wifi connection. Presently it can be configured with any one WiFi connection and that WiFi (hotspot) should be used if anyone else what to cast his screen.,5
