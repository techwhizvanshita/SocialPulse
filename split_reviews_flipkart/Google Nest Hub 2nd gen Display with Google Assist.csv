60824,"Google Nest Hub (2nd gen), Display with Google Assistant Smart Speaker?ÿ?ÿ(Charcoal)","Fantastic 2nd generation Google nest hub. Display quality is excellent. Picks up commands easily. Excellent sound quality although not as loud as HomePod mini and echo devices. Anybody with smart home setup this is the best bet as it has direct control option of all individual smart devices which are also grouped into lights, ac, fans etc. And the best part it live streams Qubo video caller bell. Currently it??s a great bet as along with it we get Google nest mini for Re1.",5
