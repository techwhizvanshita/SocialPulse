60090,HP GK320 Wired USB Gaming KeyboardÂ Â (Black),Better than I expected. The blue mechanical switches sound like heaven and the clicks are so satisfying. Even the RGB (which has total 20 different light effects) is crisp and bright and looks really stunning. 10/10 product :),5
60091,HP GK320 Wired USB Gaming KeyboardÂ Â (Black),"1st day impressions......awesome product....Drawbacks... Firstly, u kinda need to memorise the function key hotkeys as it is not shown on the keycaps., Secondly, the glossy sides of the keycaps reflect too much light makes it hideous to look at top down ....see pictures for referenceBut typing wise its way better cause i had never used a mechanical keyboard before...and led presets are awesome tooCouldnt complain more from a Rs1500 mechanical keyboard...but yah the glossy keycap sides....r...",5
60092,HP GK320 Wired USB Gaming KeyboardÂ Â (Black),Pretty good keyboard !! 20 lighting modes capable of increasing and decreasing the speeds as well as brightness..Though I didn't like the font used for lettering,5
60093,HP GK320 Wired USB Gaming KeyboardÂ Â (Black),"For 2k, the keyboard is a good option. Though it's marketed by HP but is actually a manufactured by a Chinese OEM. The keyboard is sturdy. Lightning effects are also good, though I am not a big fan of the RGBs. A simple white backlit solution is also fine for me.However, I wish the quality of the keycaps were better. They have gloss finish on the sides which makes it prone to scratches. Even if we pull the keys with the help of provided keypuller, it will still scratch the keys from the si...",3
60094,HP GK320 Wired USB Gaming KeyboardÂ Â (Black),"I will divide my review in two sections, pros and cons.Pros-1) keyboard is mechanical. Input force for the keys is 60gms which is, atleast for me, good.2) Not too noisy.2) RGB is fantastic( 16 different modes in total)3) Wore/ Cable, though not braided, is of good quality.Build is solid and feels sturdy.Cons- 1) Keys are made of ( not very good quality) ABS plastic.2) They could and should have included a palm rest.Nothing much. On a price tag of <2k, this deal is a steal.",5
60095,HP GK320 Wired USB Gaming KeyboardÂ Â (Black),"For this price range, this is the best budget mechanical keyboard you will get and that too backed by HP brand. I bought this product and i like it. Don't expect cherry switches in budget mechanical keyboards, these have Kailh blue mechanical switches which are fine for this price range.",5
60096,HP GK320 Wired USB Gaming KeyboardÂ Â (Black),"The keyboard worked properly during the return period but problems started showing up after 9 days.Keys won't work when pressed and backspace sometimes works, sometimes doesn't work and sometimes deletes 2 letters with a single press.Typing with this keyboard is now a nightmare. I am currently using my flimsy laptop keyboard for work instead of this keyboard that I paid for.The fact that it stopped working right after the return period ended means it is just a waste of money.DO NOT BUY...",1
