53481,Inalsa Easy Prep_ 800 W Food ProcessorÂ Â (Black),2 star for the product because it's quite a fragile product and 0 star for the service. Plastic should be stronger or use metal to build parts.

53485,Inalsa Easy Prep_ 800 W Food ProcessorÂ Â (Black),Don't let the low price fool you into buying it. U will regret it within Days. The product material is of very basic quality.

53497,Inalsa Easy Prep_ 800 W Food ProcessorÂ Â (Black),Product and attachments are good. Blade changing in new piece definitely needs precaution. I cut my finger while changing blade. Then after trimming the plastic was able to remove the blade. No instructions on how to remove blade. I found on YouTube still it was very tight n stuck the first time. YouTube method also will cut your finger as blade tips where we elevate with finger is razor sharp. Dono why they did not give a blunt end or plastic end to lift easily. Otherwise the working is awes...,4
