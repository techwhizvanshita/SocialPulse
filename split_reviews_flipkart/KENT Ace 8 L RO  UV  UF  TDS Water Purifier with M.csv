The best part is the after sales service, there's an app that you register to and it already has your details. Unlimited free services for 4 years is amazing, Aquaguard charges 3-4 thousand for 2 years for filter with same features. Some parts give problems sometimes (but can be solved by service) and there is no indicator ON light (its too quite to know if its ON), so gave 4 rating, otherwise its a good purchase.",4
