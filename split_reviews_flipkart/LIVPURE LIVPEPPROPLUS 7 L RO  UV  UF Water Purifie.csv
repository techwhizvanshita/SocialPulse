Came with first year check ups and service vouchers worth INR 1850 free. No issues with the installation also. Do make sure you check with the customer care if they still support installation and service. The installation guy did mention that sometime back there was a mention about Not servicing and installing purifiers bought online. As of now, they still supported when I called up the customer care...",5
183920,LIVPURE LIV-PEP-PRO-PLUS+ 7 L RO + UV + UF Water Purifier with Taste EnhancerÂ Â (White),"this is the best water purifier. build quality, storage is up to the mark but the only thing i don't like about it is it takes 23-25litre of water to purify 7 litre. but overall i am quite satisfied.",4
183921,LIVPURE LIV-PEP-PRO-PLUS+ 7 L RO + UV + UF Water Purifier with Taste EnhancerÂ Â (White),"Great value for money. product is working fine as well - no issues. Installation service, though scheduled very professionally, the end agent took his own sweet time and communication was not his strong point. overall, really happy with the product. except for small concern with the agent for service.",4
183922,LIVPURE LIV-PEP-PRO-PLUS+ 7 L RO + UV + UF Water Purifier with Taste EnhancerÂ Â (White),One of the best water purifier available in the market. At this price there is no other purifier which gives you all three (RO+UV+UF) purification. The design is compact and looks good in your kitchen. The sevice is also prompt. The company auto generates the free service appointment and the technician will come and service your purifier. I've been using the purifier from last one year and no problem found so far.,5

183924,LIVPURE LIV-PEP-PRO-PLUS+ 7 L RO + UV + UF Water Purifier with Taste EnhancerÂ Â (White),Livpure is a reputed brand regarding water purifier. I love the product.working so nicely. But one thing i would i like to share that the installation engineer has taken more money for outer purifier which is available at a reasonable rate in the local market. I suggest the company to look into this matter.,5
183925,LIVPURE LIV-PEP-PRO-PLUS+ 7 L RO + UV + UF Water Purifier with Taste EnhancerÂ Â (White),Delivery and easy installation was the best part. Purifier is of good quality build. Tap provided is quite ergonomic and well designed.Cons -There is no water level indicator and the adaptor provided does not look long lasting. Even the installation person advised me to switch off the purifier during night time so that adapter can be protected from power surge.,5
183926,LIVPURE LIV-PEP-PRO-PLUS+ 7 L RO + UV + UF Water Purifier with Taste EnhancerÂ Â (White),Best purifier available in the market as of now. With its taste enhancer you'll get a rich test. Installation was done seamlessly and i requested the guy to adjust TDS at 80 which is a good level. Tank is sufficient for whole day use and purification is very good. Other brands are just fooling us as with same configuration. Bigger brands like Kent sell it at almost 13K. Totally satisfied with this... Don't fall for other big brands. This one is perfect.,5
183927,LIVPURE LIV-PEP-PRO-PLUS+ 7 L RO + UV + UF Water Purifier with Taste EnhancerÂ Â (White),Its really cool product. I have given it 5 star rating specially for the taste of water. I paid 7k for it during offer period and its totally worth it. The service part was a also good as the installation guy came up the next day on my request. The only thing that looks shady is that he charged Rs. 650 for the external filter and that too without any bill. But overall it is a good option for a low cost water purifier.,5
183928,LIVPURE LIV-PEP-PRO-PLUS+ 7 L RO + UV + UF Water Purifier with Taste EnhancerÂ Â (White),Good product at good price but  the TDS level is very low after filtration. I am getting TDS value of 18. There should be a mechanism to control TDS.Water tastes good though,4
183929,LIVPURE LIV-PEP-PRO-PLUS+ 7 L RO + UV + UF Water Purifier with Taste EnhancerÂ Â (White),product is delivered on time as per delivery date. Installing demo was set on the next day of the delivery. The technician came for the installation of product and demo but the person is not having proper equipment for the installation of product. even that person is not having scale meter to check whether the product is set properly on wall or not. In my case product is set little bit bad in angle and not straight.  Also TDS level was not set correctly but the technician. I did the complaint...,4
