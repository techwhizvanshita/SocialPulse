84417,"MAHARAJA WHITELINE Mark1 Classic / JE-106 _ 450 W Juicer (1 Jar, Red, White)",Build quality is very good. No comments on that. But design is average. Very good for juicing Citrus fruits like orange. There are two drawbacks1. The juice spills out through the lid gaps2. Cleaning is tricky as the lid edges are sharp and might get cut and some areas are unreachable to clean. Need brush with long bristles,4
