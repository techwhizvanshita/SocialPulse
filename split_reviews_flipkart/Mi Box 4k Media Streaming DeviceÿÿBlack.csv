175034,Mi Box 4k Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),I just can't believe how amazing this device really is! It is designed exactly for the Indian users keeping in mind that many don't have a broadband connection. It officially supports mobile hotspot. All you need is a single mobile with fast internet. It even has a data saver option so that you accidentally don't use more data. It notifies after every 500 MB of data usage or whatever limit u set. U won't find a better streaming device. U can control the device using remote or even through you...,5

175037,Mi Box 4k Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"This box has all the feature of of latest Android tv, advantage over other box is that it is capable to run HD/4K content from major OTT platform like Nextflix/Prime Video etc. One more advantage is it has a Pure Android with playstore which makes this box more easy to install the apps and games direct from playstore though I have Android tv from Sony high end but still I brought this because my tv is running on Android 7 and has a low spec hardware compare this box due to this there are so...",3
175038,Mi Box 4k Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),Mirroring issue. mirroring happening only with a single device so how other family members will use it if that person not at home.jio tv not available as well as not supporting if downloading from third party.,1
175039,Mi Box 4k Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"Hardware is decent but you're mostly paying for the software, so I hope it's updated frequently, Day one review, works great, smooth animations, responsive, a great upgrade from my old Libreelec on raspberry Pi setup, all apps available from play store supported by android tv, casting is working fine after the first update, only missing feature is the playback speed control from my old setup, but again I can just have the kodi app installed and have all those features, I am sort of glad tha...",5

175042,Mi Box 4k Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),It is an amazing product it has changed by ordinary TV into a smart TV I have faced no issues and I am very much happy with the performance. The best part is I don't have Wi-Fi at my home so I use it with the mobile hotspot and it works really fine the data saver option really helps a lot to use this mibox with mobile data a must by product. Purchase it with closed eyes no problem,5
175043,Mi Box 4k Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"Very much feature rich. Value for money. Being Android TV, its easier than Firestick to sideload extra apps. USB feature and 3.5mm headphone jack is very useful.Cons: UI is not as smooth, easy or fast compared to Firestick. Remote quality feels like cheap. No mute button on remote.Overall excellent device with value for money.Additional Tip: Check availability after midnight if its out of stock.",4
175044,Mi Box 4k Media Streaming Device?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"Super media streaming box. Works without any lag. Apps open instantly. Use to media mi box 4k very easy. Also supports 3rd pary apps. Using it since 2 days continuously, and and I have no complaints about it.When u start this box, it prompt an update about 650mb.which takes time to download and install. Hight speed broadband is necessary to enjoy this 4k box. 4k YouTube video plays without any glitch.Overall it is very good media box rather then cheap android TV box.",5
