175081,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"This is bought after watching many reviews on YouTube where they say this is a very mediocre product they might be right in that but......I have read many reviews on FK as well some said it's a good product some said its not.My review about it doesn't has the heating issue it might coz many are using it with a wall mount tv which would be sticked very closely to the wall so to avoid it use a extension hdmi cable ( approx Rs. 150) my advice is to order it along, while ordering Mi Stick.N...",5
175082,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),Got it delivered within a day. I connected using my phone's hotspot and it worked flawlessly with data saver on. Audio quality is good. Google assistant is fast. The remote is tiny which I liked but would have loved if it had few more hotkeys on it for YouTube and Play Store considering there's still some space. Chromecast works fine when you connect your Mi TV Stick and phone with same wifi!I watched a prime movie same day and it was a good experience. I personally liked this as you can ca...,5
175083,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),Nice product For screen casting remember Off the data saver and go to settings - apps - view phone media - Force stop and now in smartphone go to settings and choose Wireless display or you can do with Google home appNice product simply buy it if your tv is Dabba make it Smart,5
175084,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),Good way to transform your normal TV to a Smart TV. Space could be tight to fit the stick. Some might need a HDMI cable extender like we did. Picture attached for reference. Works just perfectly! :),5

175086,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),Mind-blowing item. Again Mi proved their quality. Fantastic features. Subsidiary of android television. Picture and sound quality is awesome. Price is ok. Blindly buy it. Xtra ordinary product for non smart tv.,5
175087,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"Received the product today. So here's my review for it.The device is small and fits perfectly behind your tv. Doesn't feel cheap at all. Works fine. The setup was fast and easy. On the home screen, sliding through the apps the performance is nice and smooth. For optimal experience I'll suggest it to use with the original charger (the one that came inside the box). The video quality is good and the sound is also nice and clear. So the movie watching experience is great overall. I don't have ...",5
175088,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"This is the cheapest and the most popular Android TV stick that comes from MI brand. I bought it and was just plug and play , later added applications through the remote once wifi was added. The USB stick is very sleek design and the andriod interface is awesome and very easy to use.I have a non smart TV at home and my family was watching all. Latest OTT platform on their mobile phones which is difficult for all to watch, I thought of buying a cable that would connect mobile to TV but late...",5
175089,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"I was a big fan of Fire TV stick as I have used it for 15 months with all good but their after sales service has made me change my mind. Ultimately I have to buy new one. So I have decided to look for Android stick considering its potential of downloading app but that's not true at all what Android OS advertising. I mean what's a point if you do not have Chrome browser in OS. Coming back to MI stick, I have choose it after lot of research have been done on the availability in the market. I w...",4
175090,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"Giving 5 star because i got it for 1940 at bbd sales ..Its a good product...Good for tarvellers , easy to carry and can plug in any tvs at hotel ...Think before investing in this ,  you should have a good wifi connection in home , hdmi supported monitor or tv , and requires subscribtion to channels to enjoy this at most..  dont buy if your intention is only to cast from mob to tv and watch movies , its not that smooth..Product for its use is well worthy .",5
175091,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"If you have a dabba tv, go buy it as this is the cheapest available from a good brand like Mi. Pic and sound Quality is good. Only issue with casting which I believe should be resolved in future updates. Remote is cool and voice assistance does the wonder of not typing while searching for content on youtube. You may need to buy an hdmi extender costing around 150-200 bucks more because of its size which doesn't fit in some of the tvs. Overall a good purchase, I would strongly recommend if you...",4
175092,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),Everything works as advertised... earlier was having genric android tv box this is far better than that...I would recommend it for all those who want to enjoy  smart tv experience on a regular tv...one star less cos some time it stutters even on 100 Mbps connection and no usb port to connect keyboard.,4
175093,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"Does the job perfectly, but laggy as compared to Mi TV Box. Mi TV Box is faster than Mi TV Stick. It needs a power source (charger is provided in the box) i expected it to be usb powered. Remote is similar to Mi TV box and its Bluetooth with voice command. It's totally worth the price. But if you don't need so compact one then go for Mi TV Box, you will get a 3.5mm audio port in that and a bit faster operation.",4
175094,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"Writing this review after 5 days of usage! It is mind blowing device. I have LG LCD 32 inch TV. Initially the device took sometime to create cache, and initially you will feel the device is slow. But gradually when it starts to create cache it started working like magic. You just need to keep it connected to wifi even if you are not using it, just keep it idle. DTS sound is awesome, picture quality is superb. Overall awesome product. Happy with it",5

175104,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),"It definitely gives a good experience of SMART TV.But here are the trade-offs:1. Chromecast is good for viewing Pictures and Videos. Can also play low-level Games. But there will be lag and frame drop for PUBG, COD etc.2. Google Assistant doesn't work sometimes. Unable to detect your Voice.3.

175111,Mi TV Stick with Built in Chromecast?ÿ?ÿ(Black),I have used this product for more than 3 months now. My parents didn't wanted to upgrade to a smart TV so I got this instead. This works fine as we watch movies on weekends and series everyday for an hour. Heats up a bit but nothing to worry about. You really need a good internet connection for this. Mine is 60Mbps so it works. Earlier I used with 20Mbps so it didn't work as expected.I supply power to MI stick using the USB port at the back of my TV and HDMI port. Since I have only one HDMI ...,4
