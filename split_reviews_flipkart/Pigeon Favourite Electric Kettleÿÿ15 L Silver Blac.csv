40099,"Pigeon Favourite Electric Kettle?ÿ?ÿ(1.5 L, Silver, Black)",Very nice but you have to keep some precautions then only it will last long. Pros:1. makes black tea in exact 5 mins 2 . boiled egg in 20 mins 3. maggi in 15 mins 4. can make rice also but haven't tried 5. any boiled items you can make where the base liquid is water.
