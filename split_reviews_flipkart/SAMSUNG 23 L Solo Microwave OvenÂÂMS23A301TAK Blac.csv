124379,"SAMSUNG 23 L Solo Microwave OvenÂ Â (MS23A301TAK, Black)","After splurging on convention+microwave ovens that cost ~INR 10k for the past decade, finally realised that the only function used by an average Indian household is just reheating. That's comfortably done by this INR 5k solo microwave oven.Product itself is good. The shiny black finish looks cool.The ceramic coating inside looks durable. Probably will be easier to clean compared to the normal metal interiors. Other than that it does what it is supposed to do - heat stuff, nothing more no...",5

124381,"SAMSUNG 23 L Solo Microwave OvenÂ Â (MS23A301TAK, Black)","Those who have a nuclear family and are in search of a small but efficient microwave oven, this is it. Doesn't take much space of your kitchen but this one from samsung delivers a fantastic service. Just one reminder, you are buying the most basic micro oven. Expect that much service and you will get it. If you talk about flipkart service, it's fantastic. I got the product delivered in a nice manner by  a gentleman at a very convenient time without any hassle. So a big thumbs up for Flipkart.",5
124382,"SAMSUNG 23 L Solo Microwave OvenÂ Â (MS23A301TAK, Black)","Iâve been using an LG convection 30L microwave for last 14 years. But had hardly used anything more than reheating and once in a while defrosting. So, this time when the LG started showing signs of breaking down, we decided we needed just a microwave for reheating purpose only. Sadly, solo m/w was just maximum of 20L ones. And we wanted a bigger one. We would have been happy if it were a 25-30L. But anyways, this isnât bad either except that, it is 1.5â lesser in height and width from the 30L...",5

124386,"SAMSUNG 23 L Solo Microwave OvenÂ Â (MS23A301TAK, Black)",I had been using a National (now Panasonic) solo microwave since 1995. So you can imagine how tough it was to chose a replacement. It was tough competition and Samsung came out with flying colours. It was the switches (instead of touch) and the ceremic coating which won the battle with other brands. These were the two features because of which I didn't chose Panasonic again. The epoxy coating which other brands do is not tough enough. Panasonic still comes with rotary knobs in its solo option...,5

In 23Ltr category you will not find any Solo Microwave across any brand. 99% cases we observed that we mostly use microwave for re-heating rather cooking food. The reason I decided to buy only solo.

One star less because the glass on the window is heavily tinted and makes it almost impossible to see the contents inside the oven especially liquids. You never know if the liquid contents inside the oven have reached boiling temperature or are actually boiling and spilling due to the heavily tinted glass. Low wattage bulb inside the oven further accentuate the aforesaid problem of visibility.,4
