33233,SAMSUNG DW60M5042FW/TL Free Standing 13 Place Settings Dishwasher,Although product was delivered timely but installation was not done even after 7 days. Neither seller nor samsung customer service was interested for service support.  Very poor services by Samsung. It's suggestion to not buy Samsung products.,1
33234,SAMSUNG DW60M5042FW/TL Free Standing 13 Place Settings Dishwasher,In reviews it was written  after power interruption washer resumes washing activity from where it is left before. But it  restarts the total cycle. Otherwise cleaning performance is good. Easy to use.,5

33240,SAMSUNG DW60M5042FW/TL Free Standing 13 Place Settings Dishwasher,It is anazing.I am usually using this dishwasher twice a day. Inly one thong you shoukd consider while using this machine is makesure you are placing your utensils correctly and not keeping one item to another. At starting you will find some deficulty in placing items but after 3-4 washing you will understand how should you use it,5
33241,SAMSUNG DW60M5042FW/TL Free Standing 13 Place Settings Dishwasher,Just OKNot to say very much but in pictures it show interesting but after the delivery reality is different.It takes min. 3hours to clean all the dishes which is too long.,3
