147339,"TP-Link Archer C20 AC WiFi 750 MBPS Wireless Router?ÿ?ÿ(Blue, Dual Band)",If you want a router for medium sized Flat/home/Club use then you can go for it.After using 7 days My reviews about this router are -1) Range is average and enough for 3 BHK Apartment.After two walls it loses 1 signal.2) This dual band router has speed up to 750 MBPS.3)It has one USB port so you can connect Dongle(During absence of  LAN) & Printer.4)Easy to set up and has 3 years of warranty.5)The router looks slightly different in pictures( Original router has no white color on its   ...,5
147340,"TP-Link Archer C20 AC WiFi 750 MBPS Wireless Router?ÿ?ÿ(Blue, Dual Band)","Compact and good looking router.Two external antennas cover most of my 2 BHK flat (Except one blind spot).AC750 - both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands operate very well, though 5GHz range is much less than 2.4GHz. All the LED indicators are on the top (for keeping at table height), so if you are going to place it at a height on the wall, you won't be able to see the LED indicators (my case). In that case, one can go for Archer C20i AC750, which is same category vertical model with internal antennas....",5
147341,"TP-Link Archer C20 AC WiFi 750 MBPS Wireless Router?ÿ?ÿ(Blue, Dual Band)","Does the job. It is good for 2 BHK home usage. 2.4G has longer range than 5G. 5G has better speed but device should be close to router. It is ideal for TV and laptops. For mobile usage, 2.4G is best. Overall it is a good buy. But don't get fooled by reading 5 star reviews which say it will give you optimum speed to your devices. i.e. In 40 MBPS plan, download speed will be 5 MBPS. It doesn't work in my case. It is totally depends on your internet service provider. Also depends from where you'...",4

Signal range is good. The biggest advantage of this router is 2.4 GHz band having ""13 channels"" which supports almost all devices without interfering your neighbours.
