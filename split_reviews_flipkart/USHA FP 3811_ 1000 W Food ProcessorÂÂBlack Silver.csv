53027,"USHA FP 3811_ 1000 W Food ProcessorÂ Â (Black, Silver)","After research of 3 months on best Food processor of 1000w and considering features with quality... We finally decided to buy USHA FP 3811 and undoubtedly it's a best one among all food processor available in India.... Quality is superb, blades are too sharp, inbuilt storage space for blades, juicer is wonderful, chopper is unbelievable.. grinder works in seconds..using this from 1 months and as of now we are more than satisfied...the only missing point is that it does have french fries cutter.",5
53028,"USHA FP 3811_ 1000 W Food ProcessorÂ Â (Black, Silver)",Worth of money. Using from last one month awesome product Usha juicer grinder and machine power  is very good chopped in a second good device.,5
53029,"USHA FP 3811_ 1000 W Food ProcessorÂ Â (Black, Silver)",Excellent quality.. After about 2 months of use can say that the motor quality is top notch and you can actually feel the power of 1000W while running it.. The tough job of kneading a dough is easily handled by the processor.. The drawer beneath the main unit is an excellent place to keep the blades.. The only drawback is the high noise.,5
53030,"USHA FP 3811_ 1000 W Food ProcessorÂ Â (Black, Silver)","Wow! Just loved everything about the product, it exceeds my expectations. The appliance won't work if the locks are not set properly so make sure to do that. We struggled a bit initially but the jars always make a click sound once they are fit properly. Kneading takes like just 2 seconds and the juicer is the best part of this processor. Any other option I checked did not have the centrifugal juicer which is extremely useful. Go ahead and don't think twice. You will love this product. Thanks ...",5
53031,"USHA FP 3811_ 1000 W Food ProcessorÂ Â (Black, Silver)","Good overall quality . Grinder grinds well , mixer is good too . Juicer needs lot of improvements as it doesn't extract juice well . I ve to still use the old sujata juicer again .",3

53034,"USHA FP 3811_ 1000 W Food ProcessorÂ Â (Black, Silver)","Rest of the things work good. But i bought this due to the centrifugal juicer which do not work as expected. I found from many reviews also that juicer is not good. I used pomegranate, mausambi for the juice but it left behind a lot of waste which could have generated a lot more juice. I regret buying this instead of its lower version.I would recommend to go for FP3810 instead of this one.",3
53035,"USHA FP 3811_ 1000 W Food ProcessorÂ Â (Black, Silver)","Wanted to give at least 10 stars.But there's only 5 possible.Complete package of excitement with great build quality.Shredding chopping are done in just 5 to 10 secs max.USHA is a genius. Flipkart is a Pro.Please don't go for some negative comments. Even I was bit cautious prior to buying this. But now I am relieved.If there is something broken, you can easily replace with a good one.But there is nothing to complain about. Especially when you are new to this , go and watch some ...",5

I got it in Diwali sale for around 10K.This is only product in the market where designers were very thoughtful by providing a built-in drawer in the main body unit for storing the deadly sharp steel blades.
