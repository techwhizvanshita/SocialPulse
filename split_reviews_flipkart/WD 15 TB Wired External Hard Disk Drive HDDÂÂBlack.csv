45650,WD 1.5 TB Wired External Hard Disk Drive (HDD)Â Â (Black),Worst Experience By Flipkart Packing Was Really Disgusting and  Worst and my review is after the usage of 1 month the speed rate of copying is a bit slow and it lags sometimes and also the body of external hard disk is very smooth and delicate it's was not that much strong just I like to Give 2 Star Rating..it's okay product.,2

45661,WD 1.5 TB Wired External Hard Disk Drive (HDD)Â Â (Black),Received within 2 days.Nicely Packed.Fast Delivery.Overall Good Service.Now lets come to the product--Guyz this is 1.5TB hard disk but u will get 1.36TB as some space will be occupied by the device for  programming.No damage on product.Well Packed.But if u use 2.0 usb port with 3.0 usb cable then the data transfer speed is very low around 25 mbps but if u use 3.0 usb port with 3.0 usb cable then u will get the actual speed.Go for this Western Digital device.Thank You.Thank You Flipkart.,5
45662,WD 1.5 TB Wired External Hard Disk Drive (HDD)Â Â (Black),Speed is really slow and sometimes connection problem. Sometimes shows that there is no disk drive. So plz guyz think more about buying this hard drive. Because warranty was limited to 2 years but seagate gives you about 3 years. And other wd 1tb always 3 years. I think they know that this was failing product from wd so that's why they reduced 1 year warranty,3
45663,WD 1.5 TB Wired External Hard Disk Drive (HDD)Â Â (Black),I order on sunday 14th July and I get this on next day before 24 hrs. very fast delivery and very good product and light weight. you are geeting this in 1 tb price so go head to buy this product.,5
